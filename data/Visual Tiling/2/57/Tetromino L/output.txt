Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We need to fit Tetromino I, Tetromino T, and Tetromino L into the empty spaces without overlapping the existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 12 empty squares looks like this:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We have two variations for Tetromino I, two variations for Tetromino T, and two variations for Tetromino L.

Let's start with Tetromino I, as it has the most straightforward shape. We can see that it can only fit in the leftmost column, as it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares vertically. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Next, we have Tetromino T, which can fit in two ways, either with the middle square of the T in the second row, second column or in the fourth row, second column. However, if we place it in the second row, it will leave an isolated empty square in the first row, which cannot be filled by Tetromino L. So, we must place Tetromino T in the fourth row:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
```

Now, we have the following configuration:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
```

We can see that Tetromino L must fit into the remaining empty spaces. Variation 3 of Tetromino L has the long side horizontal and the short side extending down, which cannot fit into the remaining space. Variation 4 has the long side horizontal and the short side extending up, which fits perfectly into the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
```

Finally, we place the remaining square of Tetromino T:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino L that fits into the empty squares is Variation 4. Therefore, the answer is:

B. 4
