Let's start by examining the empty spaces and the provided polyominoes to determine how they might fit into the target rectangle.

The target rectangle has a 2x4 area at the top and a more complex shape at the bottom with a protrusion on the right side. We need to fit the Tetromino I, L, and T into these spaces.

First, let's consider the Tetromino I. It can only fit in the 2x4 area at the top in its horizontal variation (Variation 2). Placing it there, we get:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Next, let's look at the Tetromino L. We have two variations to choose from, but only Variation 4 can fit in the remaining space without overlapping the existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. Placing Variation 4 of Tetromino L, we get:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Now, we have a T-shaped space left for the Tetromino T. Looking at the variations of Tetromino T, we can see that Variation 1 fits perfectly into the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
```

Placing Variation 1 of Tetromino T, we get:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

All the empty squares are now filled without any overlaps or going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino T is:
