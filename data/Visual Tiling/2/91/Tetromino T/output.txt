Let's start by examining the empty spaces and the provided polyominoes to determine how they might fit into the target rectangle. We have a Tetromino I, a Tetromino T, and a Tetromino L, each with two variations.

First, let's look at the Tetromino I. It's clear that the only place it can fit is in the leftmost column, since it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares vertically. We'll use Variation 1 of Tetromino I:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
```

Next, let's consider the Tetromino L. We have two variations, but only Variation 5 can fit in the remaining space, as it can snugly occupy the bottom right corner. Let's place Variation 5 of Tetromino L:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Now, we have a 3x2 space left for the Tetromino T. Looking at the two variations of Tetromino T, we can see that Variation 1 will not fit because it would require a 3x3 space. However, Variation 4 fits perfectly into the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino T to fit into the remaining space is:

B. 4

The final configuration of the target rectangle is:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

And we can fill in the last empty square with the remaining part of Tetromino T:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
```
