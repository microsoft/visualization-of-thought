Let's start by examining the empty spaces and the shapes of the provided polyominoes to determine how they might fit into the target rectangle.

The target rectangle has a two-square-wide column on the left that is four squares tall. This is a perfect fit for the Tetromino I, which can fill this space either vertically (Variation 1) or horizontally (Variation 2). However, since there is a yellow square (ğŸŸ¨) blocking the bottom row, Variation 2 of Tetromino I cannot be used because it would overlap with the existing yellow square. Therefore, we must use Variation 1 of Tetromino I.

Let's place Variation 1 of Tetromino I into the target rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, let's look at the remaining empty spaces. We have a two-square-wide and two-square-tall space on the top right, which is a perfect fit for the Tetromino T (either Variation 1 or Variation 4). We also have a single empty square on the bottom right, which cannot fit any variation of Tetromino T. Therefore, we must use Variation 1 or Variation 4 of Tetromino T to fill the top right space.

Let's place Variation 1 of Tetromino T into the target rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
```

This placement doesn't work because it leaves a single empty square on the top right, which cannot be filled by any remaining polyomino. So, we must use Variation 4 of Tetromino T instead.

Let's place Variation 4 of Tetromino T into the target rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
```

Now we have a two-square-wide and two-square-tall space on the bottom right, which is a perfect fit for the Tetromino L (either Variation 1 or Variation 5). Since we need to fill the bottom row, we must use Variation 5 of Tetromino L.

Let's place Variation 5 of Tetromino L into the target rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

All the empty squares are now filled with the provided polyominoes, and we have used Variation 1 of Tetromino I. Therefore, the correct answer is:
