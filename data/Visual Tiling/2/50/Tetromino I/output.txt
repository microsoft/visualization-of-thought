Let's start by examining the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We need to fit Tetromino I, Tetromino L, and Tetromino T into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 12 empty squares looks like this:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

We have two variations for Tetromino I, which are a straight line of four blocks either vertically or horizontally. We can immediately see that Variation 1 (vertical) will not fit anywhere in the rectangle because there is no column with four consecutive empty squares. Therefore, Variation 2 (horizontal) must be the correct variation for Tetromino I.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I in the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, let's look at the Tetromino L variations. We have Variation 7 and Variation 8. Variation 7 has a vertical orientation with the "L" shape pointing to the right, and Variation 8 has the "L" shape pointing to the left. We need to find a place for one of these variations.

Looking at the remaining empty squares, we can see that Variation 7 will not fit anywhere because there is no space for the three horizontal blocks at the bottom of the "L" shape. However, Variation 8 can fit in the bottom left corner of the rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Finally, we have the Tetromino T variations. We have Variation 2 and Variation 3, both of which are vertical. We need to fit one of these into the remaining empty squares. Variation 2 has the "T" shape pointing to the right, and Variation 3 has the "T" shape pointing to the left.

Looking at the remaining empty squares, we can see that Variation 2 will fit perfectly in the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
