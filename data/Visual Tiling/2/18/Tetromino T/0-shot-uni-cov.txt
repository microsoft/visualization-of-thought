Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 12 empty squares:
```
⬜⬜⬜⬜
🟩🟩🟩🟩
🟦🟦🟦⬜
⬜🟦⬜⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬜
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino I (🟥)
2. Tetromino L (🟨)
3. Tetromino T (🟪)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```

```
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟥🟥🟥🟥
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 3 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟨🟨🟨
⬜⬜🟨
```
Variation 7 fitting into its bounding box:
```

🟨🟨🟨
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```

-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (⬜), what's the correct variation of Tetromino T?
A. 2
B. 3
C. Neither
