Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes and their variations. We need to fit the Tetromino I, Tetromino L, and Tetromino T into the empty spaces without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 12 empty squares looks like this:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations for Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥), which can either be placed vertically or horizontally. Given the configuration of the empty spaces, the only way to place the Tetromino I is horizontally at the top row, as the vertical placement would not fit anywhere.

After placing Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥), the target rectangle looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Next, we have two variations for Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨). We can see that Variation 3 of Tetromino L can fit in the bottom left corner, while Variation 7 would not fit anywhere without overlapping or going outside the rectangle.

After placing Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨), the target rectangle looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

Now, we have two variations for Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). We need to fit this into the remaining empty spaces. Variation 2 of Tetromino T cannot fit because it would require two empty spaces next to each other vertically, which we do not have. However, Variation 3 of Tetromino T fits perfectly into the remaining space.

After placing Tetromino T (ğŸŸª), the target rectangle looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the empty squares is:
