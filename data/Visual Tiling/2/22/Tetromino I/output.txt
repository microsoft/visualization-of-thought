Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We need to fit the Tetromino I, L, and T into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 12 empty squares looks like this:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations for Tetromino I, which are a vertical line and a horizontal line. We can immediately see that Variation 1 (vertical line) will not fit anywhere in the rectangle because there is no vertical space of 4 empty squares. So, Variation 1 is not the correct variation.

Variation 2 (horizontal line) seems to fit perfectly on the top row of the empty squares. Let's place it there and see what happens:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, let's look at the Tetromino T variations. Variation 3 will not fit because it requires a vertical space of 3 empty squares, which we do not have. Variation 4 requires a horizontal space of 3 empty squares with one empty square below the center, which we do have. Let's place Variation 4 in the remaining space:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Finally, we have the Tetromino L variations. Variation 7 and Variation 8 both require a space of 3 empty squares in a row with an additional square either above or below one end. Variation 7 fits perfectly in the remaining space:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

All the polyominoes fit into the target rectangle without overlapping or going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
