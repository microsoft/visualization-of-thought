Let's start by examining the empty spaces and the provided polyominoes to determine how they might fit into the target rectangle.

The target rectangle with 12 empty squares looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We have three polyominoes to fit into this space: Tetromino I, Tetromino T, and Tetromino L.

Let's start with the Tetromino I, which has two variations. Since there is a single column of four empty squares, Variation 1 of Tetromino I is the only one that can fit into that space. Let's place it there:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Next, let's look at the Tetromino L, which also has two variations. Variation 7 of Tetromino L can fit into the bottom left corner, and Variation 8 can fit into the top right corner. However, since there is already a ğŸŸª polyomino in the top right corner, Variation 7 is the only one that can fit without overlapping. Let's place Variation 7 of Tetromino L in the bottom left corner:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

Now, we have a T-shaped space left for the Tetromino T, which has two variations. Variation 3 of Tetromino T cannot fit into the remaining space because it would overlap with the existing ğŸŸª polyomino. However, Variation 4 of Tetromino T fits perfectly into the remaining space. Let's place Variation 4 of Tetromino T:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the remaining space without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle is Variation 4.

The answer is:
B. 4
