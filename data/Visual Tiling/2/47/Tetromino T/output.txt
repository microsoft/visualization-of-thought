Let's start by examining the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We need to fit Tetromino T, Tetromino L, and Tetromino I into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Target rectangle with 12 empty squares:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations for Tetromino T, two for Tetromino L, and two for Tetromino I. Let's try to fit the Tetromino I first, as it has the simplest shape and can only fit in one way due to the constraints of the rectangle.

Variation 1 of Tetromino I (ğŸŸª) can fit vertically in the second column from the right, filling up the four empty squares there. Let's place it and see how the rectangle looks:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Now we have 8 empty squares left. Let's try to fit Tetromino L next. Variation 2 of Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨) can fit in the bottom left corner, and Variation 5 can fit in the top left corner. However, if we place Variation 5 in the top left corner, it will leave a single square gap that cannot be filled by any variation of Tetromino T. Therefore, we must use Variation 2 of Tetromino L in the bottom left corner:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

Now we have 4 empty squares left, which is the exact shape and size for Tetromino T. Let's see which variation of Tetromino T can fit into the remaining space.

Variation 3 of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ©) cannot fit because it would require a vertical space of three squares, and we only have two. However, Variation 4 of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ©) fits perfectly into the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the empty squares is:
