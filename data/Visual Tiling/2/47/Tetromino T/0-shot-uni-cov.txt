Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 12 empty squares:
```
🟥🟥🟥🟥

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino T (🟩)
2. Tetromino L (🟨)
3. Tetromino I (🟪)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino T:
