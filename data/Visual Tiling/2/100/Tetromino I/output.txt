Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We need to fit Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦), Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨), and Tetromino L (ğŸŸª) into the empty spaces without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 12 empty squares looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations for Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦), which are a vertical line and a horizontal line. We can immediately see that Variation 1 (vertical line) will not fit into the rectangle without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. Therefore, we must use Variation 2 (horizontal line).

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) into the bottom row of the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have two empty spaces left in the second column from the left. We can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨) will fit perfectly into these spaces, as it is a vertical line with a protrusion in the middle. Let's place it there:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Finally, we have four empty spaces left in the top right corner, which can be filled by either Variation 3 or Variation 7 of Tetromino L (ğŸŸª). Variation 3 fits perfectly into the remaining space:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we can place the remaining part of Variation 3 of Tetromino L (ğŸŸª) to complete the puzzle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
B. 2
