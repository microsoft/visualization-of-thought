Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 12 empty squares:
```
🟥⬜⬜⬜
🟥🟥⬜⬜
🟥⬜⬜⬜
🟩🟩🟩🟩
⬜⬜⬜⬜
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino I (🟦)
2. Tetromino T (🟨)
3. Tetromino L (🟪)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```

-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 3 fitting into its bounding box:
```

-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```

-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (⬜), what's the correct variation of Tetromino I?
A. 1
B. 2
C. Neither
