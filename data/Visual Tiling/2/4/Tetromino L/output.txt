Let's start by examining the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We need to fit the Tetromino L, T, and I into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Here's the target rectangle with 12 empty squares:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have two variations for Tetromino L, three for Tetromino T, and two for Tetromino I. We need to find the correct variation for Tetromino L.

Let's first try to place the Tetromino I since it has the least flexibility in placement due to its straight shape. We can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino I (horizontal) cannot fit anywhere in the rectangle, so we must use Variation 1 (vertical). It can only fit in the second column from the left, as follows:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Next, let's look at the Tetromino T variations. Variation 3 of Tetromino T cannot fit into the remaining space without overlapping or going outside the rectangle. Variation 4 of Tetromino T can fit in the top row, as follows:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have space for the Tetromino L. We need to choose between Variation 1 and Variation 6. Let's visualize both:

Variation 1:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```
This variation doesn't fit because it overlaps with the red polyomino.

Variation 6:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```
This variation fits perfectly into the remaining space without overlapping or going outside the rectangle.

Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino L is:
