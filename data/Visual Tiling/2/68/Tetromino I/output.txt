Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We need to fit Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©), Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨), and Tetromino L (ğŸŸª) into the empty spaces without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with empty squares (â¬œ) looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations for Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©), which are a vertical line and a horizontal line. We can immediately see that the vertical line (Variation 1) will not fit anywhere in the rectangle because there is no vertical space of 4 empty squares. Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino I must be the horizontal line (Variation 2).

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) in the only possible position, which is the bottom row:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, let's look at the remaining empty spaces. We have Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸª) left to place. We have two variations for Tetromino T and two variations for Tetromino L. We need to find the correct variation and position for each.

For Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨), we can see that Variation 1 will not fit anywhere because it requires two empty squares on either side of the center square, which is not available. However, Variation 4 can fit above the existing blue Tetromino (ğŸŸ¦) with the center square of the T over the single empty square in the second row:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Finally, we have Tetromino L (ğŸŸª) left. We can see that Variation 2 will not fit anywhere, but Variation 5 can fit in the top left corner:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸªğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸªğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

All the polyominoes are now placed without overlapping and without going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino I that we used is Variation 2 (B).
