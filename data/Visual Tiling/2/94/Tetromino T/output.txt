Let's start by examining the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We need to fit Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥), Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨), and Tetromino L (ğŸŸª) into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 12 empty squares is:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have two variations for Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨), two variations for Tetromino L (ğŸŸª), and two variations for Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥).

Let's start with Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) because it has the most straightforward variations. We can see that Variation 2 (horizontal) will not fit anywhere in the target rectangle without overlapping existing polyominoes. Therefore, we must use Variation 1 (vertical) for Tetromino I.

Placing Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) Variation 1 in the only possible position:
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

The target rectangle now looks like this:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Next, let's consider Tetromino L (ğŸŸª). Variation 1 will not fit without overlapping the existing green polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. Therefore, we must use Variation 5 for Tetromino L.

Placing Tetromino L (ğŸŸª) Variation 5 in the only possible position:
â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

The target rectangle now looks like this:
```
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸªğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Finally, we have Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). We need to choose the correct variation that fits into the remaining empty squares. Variation 3 will not fit because it requires three vertical empty squares in a row, which we do not have. Therefore, we must use Variation 4 for Tetromino T.

Placing Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨) Variation 4 in the only possible position:
```
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

The target rectangle is now completely filled without any overlaps or empty squares outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino T is:
