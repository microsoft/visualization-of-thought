Let's start by examining the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We need to fit Tetromino L, Tetromino I, and Tetromino T into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

First, let's look at the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©), which has two variations: a vertical line and a horizontal line. Given the configuration of the target rectangle, the only place we can fit the Tetromino I is in the first column, as a vertical line. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Next, let's consider the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). We have two variations, but given the remaining spaces, only Variation 1 can fit into the rectangle, and it must be placed in the bottom row to fill the three consecutive empty squares. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we have only one empty square left in the bottom row, which is perfect for the bottom part of the Tetromino T:

```
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Finally, we have the Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¥) left to place. We have two variations to choose from. Variation 3 has the long part on the top and the short part on the right, while Variation 4 has the long part on the top and the short part on the left. Given the remaining empty squares, Variation 3 will not fit, but Variation 4 will fit perfectly in the top left corner. Let's place Variation 4 there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, all the empty squares are filled with the provided polyominoes, and we have used Variation 4 of the Tetromino L. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. 4
