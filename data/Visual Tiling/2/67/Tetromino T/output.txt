Let's start by placing the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) since it has the least flexibility in terms of placement due to its straight shape. We can see that it can only fit in the two vertical columns on the left side of the rectangle. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Next, let's look at the Tetromino L (ğŸŸª). We have two variations to choose from, but we can see that Variation 6 will not fit anywhere in the remaining space without overlapping the existing ğŸŸ¨ polyomino or going outside the rectangle. So we must use Variation 1 of Tetromino L:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now we have a space that is three squares high and one square wide, which is a perfect fit for Variation 3 of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦). Let's place it:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Finally, we can place the remaining square with the Tetromino T Variation 3:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T to fit into the remaining space is:

A. 3

The final configuration is:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```
