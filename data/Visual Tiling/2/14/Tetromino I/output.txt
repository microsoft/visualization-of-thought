First, let's analyze the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the shapes of the provided polyominoes to determine where each one could fit.

The target rectangle has a 4x3 area of empty squares at the top, a 3x1 area on the right side of the second row, and a 2x2 area on the right side of the fourth row. The Tetromino I can only fit in the 4x3 area at the top since it needs four consecutive squares either horizontally or vertically. The Tetromino T and L can potentially fit in the other areas.

Let's start by placing the Tetromino I, as it has the most restrictive shape:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Variation 1 of Tetromino I (vertical) cannot fit in the 4x3 area at the top because it would overlap with the existing green polyominoes. Variation 2 (horizontal) can fit perfectly at the top. So, we choose Variation 2 for Tetromino I:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, let's place the Tetromino T. We have two variations to consider, but since we have a 3x1 space on the right side of the second row, Variation 4 of Tetromino T (horizontal with a tail) is the only one that can fit there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Finally, we have the Tetromino L left. We have a 2x2 space on the right side of the fourth row, which can only accommodate Variation 7 of Tetromino L (with the tail on the left):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

All polyominoes are now placed without overlapping and without going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
