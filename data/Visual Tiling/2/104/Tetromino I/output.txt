Let's start by examining the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We need to fit Tetromino I, Tetromino L, and Tetromino T into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 12 empty squares looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations for Tetromino I, which are a vertical line and a horizontal line. We can immediately see that Variation 1 (vertical line) cannot fit into the rectangle without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The only place it could potentially fit is in the bottom row, but that would leave no space for the other polyominoes.

Variation 2 (horizontal line) can fit into the bottom row of the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, let's see if we can fit the remaining polyominoes into the empty squares. We have Tetromino L and Tetromino T left.

The Tetromino T has two variations, but Variation 4 (with the T shape) seems to fit naturally into the top left corner of the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now we only have the Tetromino L left, and it has two variations. Variation 4 of Tetromino L can fit into the remaining space:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Since we have successfully placed all polyominoes into the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle, we can conclude that the correct variation of Tetromino I is:
