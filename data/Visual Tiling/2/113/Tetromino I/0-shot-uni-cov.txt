Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 12 empty squares:
```
⬜⬜⬜⬜
🟩🟩🟩🟩
⬜⬜⬜🟪
⬜⬜🟪🟪
⬜⬜⬜🟪
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino I (🟥)
2. Tetromino L (🟦)
3. Tetromino T (🟨)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟥

🟥
🟥
```
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟥🟥🟥🟥
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟨⬜
🟨🟨
🟨⬜
```
Variation 4 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟨🟨🟨
⬜🟨⬜
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 7 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟦⬜⬜
🟦🟦🟦
```
Variation 8 fitting into its bounding box:
```
⬜⬜🟦
🟦🟦🟦
```
-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (⬜), what's the correct variation of Tetromino I?
A. 1
B. 2
C. Neither
