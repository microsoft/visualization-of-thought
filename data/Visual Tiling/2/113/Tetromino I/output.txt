Let's start by examining the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We need to fit the Tetromino I, Tetromino L, and Tetromino T into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Here's the target rectangle again for reference:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We have two variations of Tetromino I, which are a straight line of four blocks either horizontally or vertically. Let's see if we can fit either variation into the rectangle.

Variation 1 of Tetromino I:
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
This variation cannot fit into the rectangle because there is no vertical space of four empty squares.

Variation 2 of Tetromino I:
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
This variation can fit into the first row of the rectangle, which has four consecutive empty squares.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I into the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Now, let's look at the Tetromino L variations provided:

Variation 7 of Tetromino L:
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
Variation 8 of Tetromino L:
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
We can see that Variation 7 of Tetromino L can fit into the bottom left corner of the rectangle, and Variation 8 can fit into the bottom right corner. Let's place Variation 7 into the bottom left corner because it's the only place where it can fit:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Now, let's look at the Tetromino T variations provided:

Variation 2 of Tetromino T:
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
Variation 4 of Tetromino T:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
Variation 4 of Tetromino T can fit into the remaining space in the rectangle, while Variation 2 cannot. Let's place Variation 4 into the rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
```

Now, we have successfully placed all the polyominoes into the rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the rectangle is:
