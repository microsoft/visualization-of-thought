Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the polyominoes provided. We need to find a way to fit the Tetromino I, Tetromino L, and Tetromino T into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 12 empty squares looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Let's start with the Tetromino I, which has two variations. We can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino I (horizontal) can fit perfectly into the second row of the target rectangle, filling all four empty squares. Let's place it there:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, let's look at the Tetromino T, which has two variations that are vertical. We can see that either variation can fit into the third column, but we need to choose the one that allows us to place the Tetromino L correctly. Since the bottom row has three empty squares, we need the Tetromino L to cover those three squares plus one more. Variation 7 of Tetromino L can cover those squares, so we need to place the Tetromino T in such a way that it allows for Variation 7 of Tetromino L to fit.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino T in the third column, which will leave the bottom left corner open for the Tetromino L:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸªâ¬œ
```

Now, we can see that Variation 7 of Tetromino L will fit perfectly into the remaining empty squares:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino L to fit into the empty squares is:
