Let's start by examining the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes and their variations. We need to fit the Tetromino L, Tetromino I, and Tetromino T into the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 12 empty squares looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Let's start by placing the Tetromino T, as it has a unique shape that fits around the existing ğŸŸ¦ polyomino. We can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T fits perfectly around the existing ğŸŸ¦ polyomino. Let's place it there:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸªâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Next, let's look at the Tetromino L variations. We can see that Variation 3 of Tetromino L can fit in the bottom left corner, and Variation 4 can fit in the top left corner. Let's place Variation 3 in the bottom left corner because Variation 4 would not fit anywhere else due to the existing ğŸŸ¦ and ğŸŸª polyominoes:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
```

Now we have only the top row left for the Tetromino I. Since the Tetromino I has to fit into the remaining four squares in a straight line, we need Variation 2, which is the horizontal version of Tetromino I:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸªğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
