Let's start by examining the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We need to fit Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥), Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¦), and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨) into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 12 empty squares looks like this:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations for Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥), which can be placed either vertically or horizontally. Let's see which one can fit.

Variation 1 of Tetromino I:
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
Variation 2 of Tetromino I:
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

We can immediately see that Variation 1 of Tetromino I cannot fit into the rectangle because there is no vertical space of 4 empty squares. Therefore, Variation 2 must be the correct one to use.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I into the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, let's look at the Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¦) variations:

Variation 1 of Tetromino L:
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
Variation 6 of Tetromino L:
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

We can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino L can fit into the bottom left corner of the rectangle, as there is a space of 3 empty squares vertically and 2 horizontally at the bottom. Let's place it there:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Finally, let's look at the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨) variations:

Variation 1 of Tetromino T:
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
Variation 4 of Tetromino T:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ

We can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino T can fit into the remaining space in the rectangle. Let's place it there:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

All the polyominoes fit perfectly into the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino I that we used is:
