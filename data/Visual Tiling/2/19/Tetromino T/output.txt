First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We have three polyominoes to fit: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©), Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦), and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨). Let's start by fitting the Tetromino I, as it has the most straightforward variations and can only fit in one way due to its length.

Variation 1 of Tetromino I won't fit vertically because there are no four consecutive empty squares in a column. Variation 2 of Tetromino I can fit horizontally in the second row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Now, let's move on to Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨). We have two variations to consider, but looking at the empty spaces, we can see that Variation 7 will not fit anywhere because it requires two consecutive empty squares in the bottom row, which we don't have. Variation 8, however, can fit in the bottom left corner:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Finally, we have Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦). We need to fit it into the remaining three empty squares. Variation 3 of Tetromino T cannot fit because it requires a vertical space of three squares, which we don't have. Variation 4 of Tetromino T fits perfectly into the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the empty squares is:
