Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes and their variations. We need to fit the Tetromino I, T, and L into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 12 empty squares looks like this:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We have two variations for Tetromino I, two for Tetromino T, and two for Tetromino L.

Let's start with Tetromino L because it has a unique shape that can fit into the bottom left corner of the rectangle. We can use Variation 7 of Tetromino L to fit into the bottom left corner like this:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

Next, we can see that Tetromino T must fit above the Tetromino L because the other spaces are either too narrow or would require a rotation, which is not allowed. We can use Variation 2 of Tetromino T to fit it like this:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

Now, we have a 4x1 space left at the top, which is perfect for Tetromino I. We can use Variation 2 of Tetromino I to fit it horizontally like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
