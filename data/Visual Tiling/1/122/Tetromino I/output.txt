First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). The Tetromino I can be placed either vertically (Variation 1) or horizontally (Variation 2), and the Tetromino T has two variations provided, but we only need to use one.

Let's start with the Tetromino I. We need to find a place where we can fit either a vertical or horizontal line of four squares. Looking at the target rectangle, we can see that there is no place to fit a horizontal line of four squares (Variation 2), because the maximum horizontal space available is three squares wide. Therefore, we must use Variation 1 of the Tetromino I, which is vertical.

Let's place the Tetromino I (Variation 1) in the leftmost column, where there are four empty squares in a vertical line:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now we have to fit the Tetromino T. We can see that there is a perfect spot for it in the bottom right corner, where it can fit without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. We can use Variation 1 of the Tetromino T, which fits perfectly:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
