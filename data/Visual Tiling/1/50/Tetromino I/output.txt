Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle to determine where each polyomino could fit.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨).

The Tetromino I can be placed either vertically (Variation 1) or horizontally (Variation 2). The Tetromino T can be placed in two variations, but since we can only translate and not rotate or reflect, we can ignore Variation 4 for Tetromino T.

Let's first try to fit the Tetromino I, as it has fewer options for placement.

Variation 1 of Tetromino I:
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥

Variation 2 of Tetromino I:
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

If we try to fit Variation 1 of Tetromino I into the rectangle, we quickly see that it cannot be placed without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. There are no four consecutive vertical empty squares.

However, Variation 2 of Tetromino I can fit perfectly into the top row of the rectangle, filling all four empty squares horizontally.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I into the rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have only one empty square left, which is perfect for the Tetromino T, Variation 1:

â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

We can place the Tetromino T in the second row, filling the remaining empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
