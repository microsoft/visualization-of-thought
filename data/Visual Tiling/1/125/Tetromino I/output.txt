First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have 8 empty squares to fill with the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). The Tetromino I occupies 4 squares, and the Tetromino T also occupies 4 squares.

Let's consider the variations for Tetromino I:

Variation 1 (Vertical):
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©

Variation 2 (Horizontal):
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

Now, let's consider the variations for Tetromino T:

Variation 1:
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

Variation 4:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ

We can immediately see that Variation 1 of Tetromino I (vertical) cannot fit into the rectangle without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. There is no vertical space of 4 empty squares.

Variation 2 of Tetromino I (horizontal) can fit into the bottom row of the rectangle, which has exactly 4 empty squares in a row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we have 4 empty squares left in a T-shape, which perfectly matches either Variation 1 or Variation 4 of Tetromino T. We can place the Tetromino T in the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:

B. 2 (Horizontal)
