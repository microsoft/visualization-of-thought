First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). The Tetromino I can only fit in one place because it needs four consecutive empty squares either horizontally or vertically. In this rectangle, the only place it can fit is in the first column:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we have the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) left to fit into the remaining empty squares. We have two variations to choose from, but we can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T cannot fit because it would require two empty squares on top of each other, which we do not have. Variation 3 of Tetromino T, however, can fit into the remaining empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the empty squares is:
