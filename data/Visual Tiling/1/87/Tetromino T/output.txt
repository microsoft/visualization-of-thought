First, let's look at the empty spaces in the target rectangle and determine where the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) can fit. Since it's a straight line of four blocks, it can only fit in the bottom row of four empty squares. Let's place the Tetromino I there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have three empty squares left in a T-shape, which is the exact shape of the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). We can only use the variations that fit into the empty T-shaped space without rotation or reflection. Let's see which variation fits:

Variation 1 of Tetromino T:
â¬œğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª

Variation 4 of Tetromino T:
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸªâ¬œ

Since we cannot rotate or reflect the variations, only Variation 1 of Tetromino T will fit into the remaining empty space. Let's place it:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸªâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Now, we fill in the last empty square with the center of the T:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the empty squares is:
