Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I and Tetromino T. The Tetromino I can be placed either vertically (Variation 1) or horizontally (Variation 2), and the Tetromino T has two variations that can be placed without rotation or reflection.

Let's analyze the possible placements:

1. Tetromino I (Variation 1) would occupy 4 vertical squares. There is no column with 4 consecutive empty squares, so Variation 1 of Tetromino I cannot be used.

2. Tetromino I (Variation 2) would occupy 4 horizontal squares. There is one row with 4 consecutive empty squares, which is the top row. This is the only place where Variation 2 of Tetromino I can fit.

3. Tetromino T (Variation 2 and Variation 3) both occupy 3 squares in a row with one additional square adjacent to the middle square. There are two places where Tetromino T can fit: the second column from the left or the second column from the right. However, since we've determined that Tetromino I must be placed horizontally in the top row, Tetromino T must be placed in the second column from the left to avoid overlapping.

Given these observations, the correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is Variation 2 (horizontal). Let's visualize the state after placing Tetromino I (Variation 2) in the top row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

Now, we can place Tetromino T (Variation 2 or Variation 3) in the second column from the left:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

And finally, we fill the remaining empty square with the last part of Tetromino T:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

The correct answer is:
