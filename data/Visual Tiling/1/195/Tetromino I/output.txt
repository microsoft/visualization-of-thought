Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the Tetromino T and Tetromino I.

The target rectangle with empty squares (â¬œ) looks like this:
```
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have two variations of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¥) that can fit into the empty spaces:
Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¥â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥â¬œ
Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¥

And two variations of Tetromino I (ğŸŸª):
Variation 1:
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª
Variation 2:
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª

We need to fit these polyominoes into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

First, let's try to fit the Tetromino T. We can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T can fit into the left side of the rectangle, filling the three vertical empty squares and one horizontal square at the second row from the top. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have a single empty square left at the top right and three empty squares at the bottom right. The only variation of Tetromino I that can fit into the remaining empty squares is Variation 1, which is vertical. Let's place it:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

The Tetromino I fits perfectly into the remaining empty squares. Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
