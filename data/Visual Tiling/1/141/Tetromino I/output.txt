To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which variation of the Tetromino I can fit into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. Let's analyze the empty spaces and the variations of Tetromino I.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

The variations for Tetromino I are:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

We can see that the empty squares form two horizontal lines of 4 squares each. Since the Tetromino I in Variation 1 is vertical and would not fit into a horizontal line without overlapping or going outside the rectangle, it cannot be the correct variation.

Variation 2 of Tetromino I is horizontal and fits perfectly into a line of 4 squares. Therefore, Variation 2 is the correct variation to use.

Let's visualize the state after placing Variation 2 of Tetromino I into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Now we have 4 empty squares left in a T-shape, which matches the shape of the Tetromino T. We can place the Tetromino T into the remaining empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I to fit into the empty squares is:
