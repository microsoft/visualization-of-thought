First, let's visualize the target rectangle with the empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We need to fit the Tetromino T and one variation of Tetromino L into this rectangle. Let's look at the variations of Tetromino T:

Variation 1:
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

Variation 4:
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œ

Now, let's look at the variations of Tetromino L:

Variation 5:
â¬œğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

Variation 6:
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

We can see that the Tetromino T must be placed in the second row from the top because it's the only place where it can fit without overlapping the existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. We can use either Variation 1 or Variation 4 for Tetromino T, but let's choose Variation 1 for now:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Now, we have to fit Tetromino L into the remaining empty squares. We can see that Variation 5 of Tetromino L cannot fit because it would require two empty squares to be vertically aligned, which is not the case in the remaining empty squares. However, Variation 6 can fit into the remaining empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino L that fits into the empty squares is:
