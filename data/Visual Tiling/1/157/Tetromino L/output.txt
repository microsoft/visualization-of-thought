First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨). Let's start with Tetromino I, as it has only two variations and is easier to place.

Variation 1 of Tetromino I:
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©

Variation 2 of Tetromino I:
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

We can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino I cannot fit into the rectangle because there is no vertical space of 4 empty squares. Therefore, we must use Variation 2 of Tetromino I. Let's place it in the only possible position:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Now, we have to fit Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨) into the remaining empty squares. Let's look at the variations provided for Tetromino L:

Variation 4 of Tetromino L:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ

Variation 7 of Tetromino L:
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

We need to fit Tetromino L into the bottom left corner of the rectangle. Variation 4 of Tetromino L cannot fit because it would require an empty square to the left of the bottom row of the rectangle, which does not exist. Therefore, we must use Variation 7 of Tetromino L. Let's place it in the only possible position:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino L that fits into the empty squares is Variation 7.

Answer: B. 7
