Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided variations of the polyominoes to determine which variation of Tetromino I can be used to fill the empty spaces without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is as follows:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨).

Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 4:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
Variation 7:
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

Now, let's try to fit the Tetromino I into the target rectangle. We can see that there is a row with four consecutive empty squares, which matches the shape of Variation 2 (horizontal) of Tetromino I. Variation 1 (vertical) would not fit into the rectangle without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I into the target rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Now we have two L-shaped spaces left for Tetromino L. We can see that Variation 4 of Tetromino L can fit into the bottom left corner, and Variation 7 can fit into the space above it. Let's place them:

Variation 4 of Tetromino L:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

Variation 7 of Tetromino L:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is Variation 2 (horizontal). Therefore, the answer is:
