First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino L (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¨). Each has two variations that we can use.

Let's start by trying to fit the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¨), since it has a straight shape and can only fit in certain places. We have two variations: a vertical line (Variation 1) and a horizontal line (Variation 2).

Looking at the target rectangle, we can see that the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¨) can only fit in the bottom row as a horizontal line (Variation 2), because the vertical line (Variation 1) would not fit anywhere without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

So, we place the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¨) in the bottom row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we have to fit the Tetromino L (ğŸŸ©). We have two variations to consider: Variation 3 and Variation 7.

Variation 3 of Tetromino L (ğŸŸ©) looks like this:

ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ©

Variation 7 of Tetromino L (ğŸŸ©) looks like this:

ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

We need to fit the Tetromino L (ğŸŸ©) into the remaining empty squares without overlapping or going outside the rectangle. If we try to fit Variation 3, we can see that it won't fit because it would require an empty square to the right of the bottom-most ğŸŸ©, which is not available.

However, Variation 7 fits perfectly into the remaining empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino L to fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares is:
