Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
⬜⬜⬜⬜
🟩🟩🟩🟪
⬜🟩🟨🟪
⬜🟨🟨🟪
⬜⬜🟨🟪
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino I (🟥)
2. Tetromino L (🟦)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟥
🟥
🟥
🟥
```
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟥🟥🟥🟥
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟦🟦
🟦⬜
🟦⬜
```
Variation 6 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟦⬜
🟦⬜
🟦🟦
```
-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (⬜), what's the correct variation of Tetromino L?
A. 1
B. 6
C. Neither
