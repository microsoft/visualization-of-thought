Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the polyominoes provided.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¦).

The Tetromino I can only fit in the rectangle in its Variation 2 (horizontal) because the vertical column of empty squares is not tall enough to accommodate Variation 1 (vertical). Let's place the Tetromino I in the only possible position:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

Now, we have the following empty spaces left for the Tetromino L:

â¬œ
â¬œ
â¬œâ¬œ

We need to fit the Tetromino L into these spaces. Let's examine the provided variations for Tetromino L:

Variation 1:
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ

Variation 6:
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

By looking at the remaining empty spaces, we can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino L will not fit because it requires two empty squares next to each other horizontally at the top, which we do not have. However, Variation 6 will fit perfectly into the remaining empty spaces.

Let's place Variation 6 of Tetromino L into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino L that fits into the empty squares is:
