Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I and Tetromino T. Tetromino I can be placed either vertically (Variation 1) or horizontally (Variation 2), and Tetromino T has two variations that allow for translation but not rotation or reflection.

Let's first try to fit Tetromino T, as it has a unique shape that might only fit in one specific way. Looking at the empty squares, we can see that the Tetromino T cannot fit in the top row, as it would require a 3x3 area to accommodate its shape. Therefore, it must be placed in the second or third row.

The only place where Tetromino T can fit is in the second and third rows, with the following configuration:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Now, we have a 4x1 space left at the top, which perfectly fits Variation 2 of Tetromino I. If we were to use Variation 1 of Tetromino I, we would not be able to fit it vertically anywhere in the rectangle. Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino I must be Variation 2.

The final configuration is:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

So the correct variation of Tetromino I is:
