First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸª). We need to choose the correct variation of Tetromino L that will fit into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's start with Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥), which has two variations. Since there is a vertical column of four empty squares on the left side of the rectangle, we can fit Variation 1 of Tetromino I there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we have three empty squares remaining, which must be filled by Tetromino L (ğŸŸª). We have two variations of Tetromino L to choose from. Let's try Variation 1 first:

Variation 1 of Tetromino L:
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªâ¬œ

If we try to fit Variation 1 into the remaining empty squares, we can see that it will not fit because it requires four squares in a specific L-shape that is not available in the remaining empty spaces.

Now let's try Variation 5 of Tetromino L:

Variation 5 of Tetromino L:
â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸª

This variation can fit into the remaining empty squares as follows:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

As we can see, Variation 5 of Tetromino L fits perfectly into the remaining empty squares. Therefore, the correct answer is:
