First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

We have two polyominoes to fit: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦). We need to use their variations to fill the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's start with Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥), which has two variations. We can immediately see that Variation 2 of Tetromino I (horizontal) cannot fit into the rectangle because there is no horizontal space of 4 consecutive empty squares. Therefore, we must use Variation 1 (vertical):

ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥

We can place this variation in the first column of the rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we have to fit Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦). We have two variations to choose from. Let's visualize each variation to see which one fits:

Variation 1 of Tetromino T:
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

Variation 4 of Tetromino T:
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œ

We need to fit Tetromino T into the remaining empty squares. Looking at the remaining empty squares, we can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino T cannot fit because it would require two empty squares above a single empty square, which we do not have. However, Variation 4 of Tetromino T fits perfectly into the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the empty squares is:
