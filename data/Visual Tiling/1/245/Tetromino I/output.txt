First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino T (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino I (ğŸŸª). We need to choose the correct variation for each polyomino that will fit into the empty squares without overlapping or going outside the rectangle.

Let's start with the Tetromino T variations. We have two variations to choose from:

Variation 2:
ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬œ

Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œğŸŸ©

We can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T cannot fit into the rectangle because it would require a 3x2 area of empty squares, which we do not have. Variation 3, however, can fit into the rectangle in the leftmost column, as it matches the pattern of empty squares there. Let's place Variation 3 of Tetromino T into the rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
```

Now, we have a 4x1 area of empty squares remaining, which perfectly fits Variation 1 of Tetromino I. Variation 2 of Tetromino I would not fit because it requires a 1x4 area of empty squares, and we do not have such a space horizontally. Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino I is Variation 1.

Let's place Variation 1 of Tetromino I into the rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I is:
