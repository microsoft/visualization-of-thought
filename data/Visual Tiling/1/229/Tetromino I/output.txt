To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which variation of the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) will fit into the empty squares (â¬œ) without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. We also need to ensure that the Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨) can fit into the remaining space.

Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

We have a horizontal space of four squares on the second row, which is a perfect fit for Variation 2 of the Tetromino I. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Now, we have three empty squares left in a shape that matches Variation 7 of the Tetromino L. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

And finally, we fill in the last two squares with the remaining part of Variation 7 of the Tetromino L:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is Variation 2 (B). All the polyominoes fit perfectly into the target rectangle without overlapping or going outside the rectangle.
