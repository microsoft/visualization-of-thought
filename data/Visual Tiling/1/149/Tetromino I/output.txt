Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided variations of the polyominoes to determine which variation of Tetromino I can be used to fill the empty spaces without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is as follows:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨).

The variations for Tetromino I are:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

The variations for Tetromino T are:
Variation 1:
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
Variation 4:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ

Now, let's try to fit the Tetromino T first, as it has a more complex shape than the Tetromino I. We can see that there is only one place where Tetromino T can fit without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle, which is at the bottom left corner. We can use either Variation 1 or Variation 4 for Tetromino T, but let's choose Variation 1 for this example:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

Now, we have a vertical space of 4 empty squares on the left side, which perfectly matches the shape of Variation 1 of Tetromino I. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

As we can see, Variation 1 of Tetromino I fits perfectly into the empty space without overlapping or going outside the rectangle. Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino I is:
