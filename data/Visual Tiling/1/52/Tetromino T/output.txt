Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We have a Tetromino T and a Tetromino I to place, and we need to determine which variation of Tetromino T will fit.

The target rectangle with empty squares (â¬œ) looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ©) to consider:
Variation 2:
ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬œ
Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œğŸŸ©

And two variations of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦):
Variation 1:
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

We can immediately see that the Tetromino I must be placed vertically (Variation 1) to fill the four empty squares in the bottom row of the target rectangle. This is because there is no horizontal space of four consecutive empty squares anywhere else in the rectangle.

After placing Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) Variation 1, the target rectangle looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we need to fit the Tetromino T. We have two empty squares on the second row and two empty squares on the third row, which are adjacent to each other, forming a 2x2 square. This configuration matches Variation 2 of Tetromino T, which can be placed in a way that the single square on the top and bottom of the T fits into the single empty squares on the second and fourth rows, respectively.

Placing Tetromino T (ğŸŸ©) Variation 2, the target rectangle looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino T to fit into the target rectangle is:
