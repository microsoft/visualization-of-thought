First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify where each polyomino could potentially fit. We have two types of polyominoes: Tetromino I and Tetromino L. The Tetromino I can only fit in a straight line of 4 empty squares, either horizontally or vertically. The Tetromino L needs a set of 3 squares in a line with one adjacent square at one end.

Here's the target rectangle again for reference:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We can see that the Tetromino I can only fit in the second row horizontally because there are no vertical spaces of 4 empty squares. Let's place the Tetromino I there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, we have three empty squares left, which must be filled by the Tetromino L. The Tetromino L variations provided are:

Variation 7:
ğŸŸªâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª

Variation 8:
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª

We need to fit the Tetromino L in the bottom right corner of the rectangle. Variation 7 cannot fit because it would require an empty square to the left of the bottom row of the L shape, which is not available. Variation 8, however, can fit perfectly with the single square on the top right and the three squares in a line on the bottom.

Let's place Variation 8 of the Tetromino L:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino L that fits into the empty squares is:
