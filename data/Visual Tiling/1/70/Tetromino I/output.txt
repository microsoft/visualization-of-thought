To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which variation of the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) can fit into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. Let's analyze the empty spaces and the provided variations.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©):
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

We also have two variations of Tetromino L (ğŸŸª):
Variation 7:
ğŸŸªâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
Variation 8:
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª

Looking at the target rectangle, we can see that the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) must be placed in the second row, as it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares. This means we must use Variation 2 (horizontal) of the Tetromino I.

After placing Variation 2 of Tetromino I, the rectangle looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, we need to place one of the Tetromino L (ğŸŸª) variations into the remaining empty squares. Variation 7 of Tetromino L can fit into the bottom left corner, and Variation 8 can fit into the bottom right corner. Since we are not asked which variation of Tetromino L to use, we can conclude that the correct variation of Tetromino I is:
