First, let's visualize the target rectangle with the empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino T and Tetromino I. Let's consider the variations of Tetromino T first:

Variation 1 of Tetromino T:
â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

Variation 4 of Tetromino T:
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œ

We can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino T cannot fit into the rectangle because it would require two empty squares to be horizontally adjacent at the middle level of the rectangle, which is not the case. However, Variation 4 can fit into the rectangle if we place it in the bottom left corner, like this:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, let's consider the variations of Tetromino I:

Variation 1 of Tetromino I:
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦

Variation 2 of Tetromino I:
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

Given the remaining empty squares, Variation 1 of Tetromino I cannot fit because there are no four vertically consecutive empty squares. However, Variation 2 can fit horizontally in the bottom row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now we have one empty square left, which is exactly the space needed for the center square of Variation 4 of Tetromino T. Let's place it:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is Variation 2 (B).
