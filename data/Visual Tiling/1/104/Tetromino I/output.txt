First, let's look at the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the Tetromino L and Tetromino I. We need to find a way to fit these polyominoes into the empty spaces without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 4:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
Variation 7:
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

And two variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1:
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª
Variation 2:
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª

Let's try to fit the Tetromino L first, as it has an L-shape that might fit into the bottom left corner of the target rectangle. We can see that Variation 7 of Tetromino L fits perfectly into the bottom left corner, filling the three empty squares in the last row and one in the second-to-last row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we have four empty squares left in a straight line, which matches the shape of Tetromino I. Since the empty squares are in a vertical line, we need Variation 1 of Tetromino I to fill them:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
