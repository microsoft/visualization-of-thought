Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (â¬œ) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨)
2. Tetromino I (ğŸŸª)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 4 fitting into its bounding box:
```
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
```
Variation 7 fitting into its bounding box:
```
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª
```
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```
-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (â¬œ), what's the correct variation of Tetromino I?
A. 1
B. 2
C. Neither
