First, let's analyze the empty spaces in the target rectangle to determine where each polyomino could fit.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦).

Let's start with Tetromino I, which has two variations. We need to find a place where either a straight line of 4 squares (Variation 2) or a column of 4 squares (Variation 1) can fit.

Variation 1 (vertical) cannot fit anywhere in the rectangle because there is no column of 4 consecutive empty squares.

Variation 2 (horizontal) can fit in the top row of the rectangle, which has 4 consecutive empty squares.

Now let's visualize the state after placing Variation 2 of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) in the top row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

With Tetromino I placed, we now have to fit Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦). We can see that there is only one place where Tetromino T can fit, which is on the left side of the rectangle, using Variation 3.

Let's visualize the state after placing Variation 3 of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

However, we made a mistake. Variation 3 of Tetromino T does not fit in the remaining space because it would overlap with the existing ğŸŸª polyomino. We need to use Variation 2 of Tetromino T instead. Let's correct this and visualize the state after placing Variation 2 of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Now we can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T fits perfectly into the remaining space without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:

B. 2

And the final configuration is:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```
