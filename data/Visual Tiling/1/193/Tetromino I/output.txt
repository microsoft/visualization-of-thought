First, let's visualize the target rectangle with the empty squares (â¬œ) and the existing polyominoes:

```
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦). We need to determine which variation of Tetromino I will fit.

Let's start by trying to fit the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¥) variations into the rectangle. We can see that there is only one place where Tetromino T can fit, which is in the top left corner, using Variation 2:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, we have the following configuration:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We need to fit Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) into the remaining empty squares. We have two variations of Tetromino I to consider:

Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦

Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

Given the remaining empty squares, we can see that Variation 1 (vertical) will not fit anywhere in the rectangle because there are no four vertically contiguous empty squares. However, Variation 2 (horizontal) will fit perfectly in the bottom row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
