First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦). We need to determine which variation of Tetromino I will fit.

Let's consider the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦) first. We have two variations to choose from, but we can see that Variation 4 will not fit anywhere in the rectangle without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. Therefore, we must use Variation 1 of Tetromino T.

Variation 1 of Tetromino T fits perfectly in the bottom left corner:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
```

Now, we have to fit Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥). We have two variations to choose from. Variation 1 is vertical, and Variation 2 is horizontal.

If we try to fit Variation 1 (vertical) of Tetromino I, we can see that it won't fit anywhere in the remaining empty squares without overlapping or going outside the rectangle.

However, Variation 2 (horizontal) of Tetromino I fits perfectly in the top row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
```

So the correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
