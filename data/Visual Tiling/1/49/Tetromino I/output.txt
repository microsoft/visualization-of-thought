Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ©).

The Tetromino I can be placed either horizontally or vertically, and the Tetromino T has two variations that can be placed vertically.

Let's consider the Tetromino T first. We can see that there is only one place where a vertical T can fit, which is on the left side of the rectangle. We can place Variation 2 of Tetromino T there:

ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬œ

Fitting this variation into the target rectangle, we get:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have a 4x1 space left for the Tetromino I, which means we must use Variation 2 of Tetromino I to fill this space:

ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

Fitting this variation into the target rectangle, we get the final configuration:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino I to fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares is:
