Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided variations of the polyominoes to determine which variation of Tetromino I can be used.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

We have two variations of Tetromino I:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

We also have two variations of Tetromino L:
Variation 4:
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
Variation 7:
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

Now, let's try to fit the Tetromino L variations first, as they have an L shape that might fit into the corners of the empty spaces.

If we look at the bottom left corner of the target rectangle, we can see that Variation 4 of Tetromino L can fit perfectly into the empty spaces there:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, the remaining empty spaces form a straight line, which is perfect for Tetromino I. Since the empty spaces are horizontal, we need Variation 2 of Tetromino I to fit into the space:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
B. 2

The final configuration of the target rectangle with all polyominoes placed is:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```
