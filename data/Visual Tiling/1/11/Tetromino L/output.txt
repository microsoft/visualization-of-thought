First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We have two types of polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨). We need to use one of each to fill the empty squares.

Let's start with the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥), which has two variations. Since there are four empty squares in a row at the top of the rectangle, we can use Variation 2 of Tetromino I to fill those squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Now, we have three empty squares left to fill with the Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨). We can see that the remaining empty squares form an 'L' shape, which matches the shape of the Tetromino L. We have two variations of Tetromino L to choose from, Variation 5 and Variation 6.

Let's try Variation 5:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

As we can see, Variation 5 of Tetromino L fits perfectly into the remaining empty squares. Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino L to use is:
