First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸª). The Tetromino I can only fit in a straight line of 4 empty squares, either horizontally or vertically. The Tetromino L needs to fit into a configuration of 3 squares in a row with one square extending from the second square either upwards or downwards.

Let's start with the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©). There is only one place where it can fit, which is vertically in the first column:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, we have to fit the Tetromino L (ğŸŸª). We have two variations to choose from, and we need to find the one that fits into the remaining empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's try Variation 2 of Tetromino L:

ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª

If we try to fit Variation 2, we can see that it cannot be placed without overlapping the existing Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) or going outside the rectangle.

Now let's try Variation 5 of Tetromino L:

â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸª

This variation can fit perfectly into the remaining empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

So the correct variation of Tetromino L that fits into the empty squares is:
