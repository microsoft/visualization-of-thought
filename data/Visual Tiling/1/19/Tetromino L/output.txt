First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

We have two polyominoes to fit: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸª). The Tetromino I can only fit in the vertical or horizontal line of 4 empty squares. In the target rectangle, there is only one place where Tetromino I can fit, which is vertically in the first column. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we have to fit the Tetromino L. There are two variations, but we can see that only one variation will fit the remaining empty squares. Variation 1 of Tetromino L will not fit because it would require two empty squares on top of each other, which we do not have. Variation 2 of Tetromino L will fit because it matches the pattern of the remaining empty squares. Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino L:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

The correct variation of Tetromino L that fits into the empty squares is:
