Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares looks like this:
```
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸª).

The Tetromino I has two variations:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

The Tetromino L has two variations, but since we can only translate and not rotate or reflect, we can consider only the first variation as the second one is a reflection:
Variation 1 for Tetromino L:
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªâ¬œ

Now, let's try to fit the Tetromino I into the rectangle. We can immediately see that Variation 2 (horizontal) of Tetromino I cannot fit into the rectangle because there is no row with four consecutive empty squares. Therefore, we must use Variation 1 (vertical) of Tetromino I.

Let's place Variation 1 of Tetromino I into the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we have to fit the Tetromino L into the remaining empty squares. The only place it can fit is in the top right corner, using Variation 1 of Tetromino L:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

We have successfully placed both polyominoes into the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
