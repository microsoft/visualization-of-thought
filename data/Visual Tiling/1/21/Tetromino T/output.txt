First, let's look at the empty spaces in the target rectangle and determine where the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) can fit. Since it's a straight line of four blocks, it can only fit in the bottom row of the target rectangle. Let's place the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we have three empty squares left in the target rectangle, which form a T shape. This is perfect for the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). We can only use the variations that allow translation, not rotation or reflection. Let's see which variation of Tetromino T can fit into the remaining space.

Variation 1 of Tetromino T:
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

Variation 4 of Tetromino T:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ

Since we cannot rotate or reflect the variations, we can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino T fits perfectly into the remaining space. Let's place it:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T to fit into the remaining space is:
