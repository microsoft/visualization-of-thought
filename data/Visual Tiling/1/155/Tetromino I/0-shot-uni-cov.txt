Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
⬜⬜⬜⬜
🟩🟩🟩🟩
🟦🟦🟦⬜
🟨🟦⬜⬜
🟨🟨🟨⬜
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino I (🟥)
2. Tetromino T (🟪)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟥
🟥
🟥
🟥
```
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟥🟥🟥🟥
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟪⬜
🟪🟪
🟪⬜
```
Variation 3 fitting into its bounding box:
```
⬜🟪
🟪🟪
⬜🟪
```
-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (⬜), what's the correct variation of Tetromino I?
A. 1
B. 2
C. Neither
