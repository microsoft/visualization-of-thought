To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which variation of the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) can fit into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. We also need to consider where the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) can fit.

Let's start by looking at the empty spaces in the target rectangle:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

We have a horizontal space of 4 empty squares on the top row and three single empty squares on the right side of the rectangle. The Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) can either be placed horizontally or vertically. If we place it horizontally, it will fill the top row completely. If we place it vertically, it will not fit in the single empty squares on the right side.

Let's try placing the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) horizontally (Variation 2) on the top row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

Now we have three single empty squares left. We can see that the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) cannot fit horizontally or vertically in a straight line, so we must use one of the variations that have a "T" shape. Both Variation 2 and Variation 3 of the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) can fit into the remaining spaces, but we only need to use one of them.

Let's try placing Variation 2 of the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

As we can see, Variation 2 of the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) fits perfectly into the remaining empty squares. Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino I is:
