Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle has a single column of four empty squares on the right side, which perfectly matches the shape of Variation 1 of Tetromino I. The remaining empty squares form a shape that does not match Variation 2 of Tetromino I but does match one of the variations of Tetromino T.

Here's the reasoning step by step:

1. Place Variation 1 of Tetromino I (游릳) into the single column of four empty squares on the right side of the rectangle:

```
游린游린游린游린
游릴游릴游릴游릳
游릴游릱游릳游릳
游릱游릱游릱游릳
游릳游릳游릳游릳
```

2. Now, we have a T-shaped set of empty squares remaining, which matches Variation 2 of Tetromino T (游릵):

```
游린游린游린游린
游릴游릴游릴游릳
游릴游릱游릵游릳
游릱游릱游릱游릳
游릵游릵游릵游릳
```

3. Place Variation 2 of Tetromino T (游릵) into the T-shaped set of empty squares:

```
游린游린游린游린
游릴游릴游릴游릳
游릴游릱游릵游릳
游릱游릱游릱游릳
游릵游릵游릵游릳
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is Variation 1 (A). The Tetromino T fits into the remaining space with its Variation 2.
