First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦). The Tetromino I can only fit in a straight line of four empty squares, either horizontally or vertically. The Tetromino T needs to fit in a configuration of three squares in a row with one additional square adjacent to the middle square.

Let's start with the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©), as it has the most restrictive shape. We can see that there is only one place where it can fit: vertically in the first column. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we have to fit the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦). We have two variations to choose from, but we can see that Variation 2 will not fit in the remaining space because it requires two empty squares above the base of the T, and there is only one available. Variation 3, however, fits perfectly into the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the empty squares is:
