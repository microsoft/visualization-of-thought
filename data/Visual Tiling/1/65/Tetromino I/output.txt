Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦).

Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¦

Now, let's try to fit the Tetromino T first, since it has a more complex shape and fewer options for placement. We can see that the Tetromino T can only fit in one place in the target rectangle, which is on the left side, using Variation 2. Let's place it there:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Now, we have a 4x1 space left at the top of the rectangle, which is perfect for the Tetromino I. The only variation of Tetromino I that can fit into this space is Variation 2 (horizontal). Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
