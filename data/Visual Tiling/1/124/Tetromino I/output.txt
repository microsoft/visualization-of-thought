First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¦). We need to determine which variation of Tetromino I will fit.

Let's start by trying to fit the Tetromino I variations:

Variation 1 (Vertical):
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©

Variation 2 (Horizontal):
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

We can see that Variation 1 (Vertical) will not fit into the rectangle because there is no vertical space of 4 empty squares. However, Variation 2 (Horizontal) can fit into the bottom row of the rectangle, which has 4 consecutive empty squares.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I into the rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we need to fit Tetromino L into the remaining empty squares. We have two variations of Tetromino L:

Variation 1:
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ

Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¦

We can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino L can fit into the remaining empty squares on the left side of the rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

And the final square can be filled with the remaining part of Tetromino L:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
