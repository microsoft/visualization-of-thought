Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided variations of the polyominoes to determine how they could fit.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦).

Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¦

We need to fit these polyominoes into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

First, let's look at the Tetromino T variations. Variation 2 and Variation 3 of Tetromino T are mirror images of each other, and since we are not allowed to use reflections, we must choose the variation that fits the existing empty spaces without rotation.

The bottom left corner of the rectangle has a vertical space of three squares that could potentially fit either Variation 2 or Variation 3 of Tetromino T. However, Variation 3 would leave an isolated empty square that could not be filled by any of the Tetromino I variations. Therefore, we must use Variation 2 of Tetromino T.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino T in the bottom left corner:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Now we have a horizontal space of four squares at the top of the second row, which perfectly fits Variation 2 of Tetromino I. Variation 1 of Tetromino I would not fit anywhere in the remaining empty spaces.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I in the second row:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

All empty squares are now filled, and we have used Variation 2 of Tetromino I and Variation 2 of Tetromino T. The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
