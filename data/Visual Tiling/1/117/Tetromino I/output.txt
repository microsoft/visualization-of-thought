To solve this puzzle, we need to place the Tetromino T and Tetromino I into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. Let's start by examining the possible placements for each polyomino.

First, let's look at the Tetromino T variations. We have two variations to consider:

Variation 1 of Tetromino T:
⬜🟩⬜
🟩🟩🟩

Variation 4 of Tetromino T:
🟩🟩🟩
⬜🟩⬜

Now, let's look at the empty spaces in the target rectangle. We have a 2x3 area at the bottom and a single square sticking out on the third row. This single square sticking out is a key indicator of where the Tetromino T must go, as it fits the shape of either variation of the Tetromino T. We can place the Tetromino T in such a way that the single square of the T fits into the single empty square on the third row.

Let's place Variation 1 of Tetromino T into the target rectangle:

```
🟥🟥🟨🟪
🟥🟨🟨🟪
🟥🟩🟨🟪
🟩🟩🟩🟪
⬜⬜⬜⬜
```

Now, we have a 1x4 area left at the bottom, which perfectly fits Variation 2 of Tetromino I. Let's place it:

```
🟥🟥🟨🟪
🟥🟨🟨🟪
🟥🟩🟨🟪
🟩🟩🟩🟪
🟦🟦🟦🟦
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the remaining empty squares is Variation 2. Therefore, the answer is:

B. 2
