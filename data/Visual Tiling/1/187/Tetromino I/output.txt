First, let's analyze the empty spaces in the target rectangle to determine where each polyomino could fit. We have a vertical space of 4 empty squares on the left side and a horizontal space of 3 empty squares on the bottom. Since the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) needs to occupy 4 squares in a straight line, it can only fit in the vertical space on the left side. This means we must use Variation 1 of Tetromino I.

Now let's visualize the state after placing Variation 1 of Tetromino I into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
```

Next, we need to place the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). We have two variations to consider, but since we have already placed the Tetromino I, we can see that only Variation 3 of Tetromino T can fit into the remaining space, as it matches the shape of the empty squares.

Let's visualize the state after placing Variation 3 of Tetromino T into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
```

All the empty squares are now filled with the provided polyominoes, and the correct variation of Tetromino I that we used is:
