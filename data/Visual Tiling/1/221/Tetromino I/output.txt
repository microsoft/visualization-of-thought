To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which variation of the Tetromino I can fit into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. Let's analyze the empty spaces and the variations of the Tetromino T provided to see where they can fit.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations of the Tetromino T to consider:
Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ

Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨

We can see that Variation 2 of the Tetromino T cannot fit into the empty spaces because it would require a vertical column of three empty squares, which we do not have. However, Variation 3 can fit into the empty spaces on the left side of the rectangle, as it matches the pattern of the empty squares there.

Let's place Variation 3 of the Tetromino T into the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, we have a horizontal row of four empty squares at the bottom, which perfectly fits Variation 2 of the Tetromino I. Let's place it there:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

All the empty squares are now filled, and we used Variation 2 of the Tetromino I. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. 2
