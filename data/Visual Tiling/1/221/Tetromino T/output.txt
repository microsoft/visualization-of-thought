First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). The Tetromino I can only fit in the bottom row since it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares, either horizontally or vertically. Let's place the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) in the bottom row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we have three empty squares left to fill with the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). We can see that the remaining empty squares form a T shape, which matches the shape of the Tetromino T. Let's look at the variations of Tetromino T to see which one can fit:

Variation 2 of Tetromino T:
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ

Variation 3 of Tetromino T:
â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨

We can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨) fits perfectly into the remaining empty squares, as it matches the T shape formed by the empty squares. Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨) into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T to fit into the empty squares is Variation 2.
