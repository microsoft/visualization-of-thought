First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). The Tetromino I can only fit in the vertical gap on the left side of the rectangle because it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares vertically. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we have to fit the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) into the remaining empty squares. We have two variations to choose from, but we can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T cannot fit because it would require two empty squares horizontally next to each other, which we do not have. Let's visualize Variation 2 to confirm:

Variation 2:
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ

There is no place in the target rectangle where this variation can fit without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Now let's consider Variation 3 of Tetromino T:

Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª

This variation can fit into the remaining empty squares on the right side of the rectangle. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now all the empty squares are filled without any overlaps or going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the target rectangle is:
