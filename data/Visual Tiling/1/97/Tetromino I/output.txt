First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©). We need to determine which variation of Tetromino I will fit.

Let's start by placing the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¥) since it has a unique shape that can only fit in one place without rotation or reflection. The only place it can fit is at the top left corner, using Variation 4:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we have the following empty squares left:

```
â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

We need to fit the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) into these remaining squares. The Tetromino I can either be placed vertically (Variation 1) or horizontally (Variation 2). Since there is no horizontal space of 4 consecutive empty squares, Variation 2 cannot be used. Therefore, we must use Variation 1, which is the vertical placement of Tetromino I.

Placing Variation 1 of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) into the empty squares, we get:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

All the empty squares are now filled without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino I is:
