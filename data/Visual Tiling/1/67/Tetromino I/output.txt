To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which variations of the provided polyominoes can fit into the empty squares of the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to place: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸª). We need to find a place for each of them.

First, let's consider the Tetromino I variations. We have a horizontal variation (Variation 2) and a vertical variation (Variation 1).

Variation 1 (vertical) would not fit anywhere in the rectangle because there is no column with four consecutive empty squares.

Variation 2 (horizontal) would fit perfectly in the top row of the rectangle, which has four consecutive empty squares.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) in the top row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, we have to place the Tetromino L (ğŸŸª). We have two variations to consider, Variation 4 and Variation 8. We need to find a place for one of these variations in the remaining empty squares.

Variation 4 (ğŸŸª) would not fit because it requires three consecutive empty squares in a row and one below the first square, which is not available.

Variation 8 (ğŸŸª) would fit perfectly in the bottom right corner of the rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Now, we can place the remaining part of Variation 8 to complete the puzzle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
