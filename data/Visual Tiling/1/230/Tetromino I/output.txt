First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). We need to determine which variation of Tetromino I will fit.

Let's start with the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) because it has a unique shape that can only fit in certain ways. We have two variations of Tetromino T to consider, but we can see that Variation 4 will not fit anywhere in the rectangle without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. Therefore, we must use Variation 1 of Tetromino T.

Variation 1 of Tetromino T can fit in the bottom right corner of the rectangle, like this:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Now, we have a 4x1 space left for the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©). We can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino I, which is vertical, will not fit into this horizontal space. Therefore, we must use Variation 2 of Tetromino I, which is horizontal.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I into the rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Now, we have successfully filled all the empty squares (â¬œ) with the provided polyominoes without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The correct variation of Tetromino I is:
