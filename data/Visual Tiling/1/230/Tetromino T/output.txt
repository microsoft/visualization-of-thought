First, let's look at the empty spaces in the target rectangle and determine where the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) can fit. Since it's a straight line of four blocks, it can only fit horizontally in the second row of the target rectangle. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, we have three empty squares left, which must be filled by the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). The only way to fit the T shape into the remaining space is to use Variation 1, which has the following shape:

â¬œğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª

Let's place Variation 1 of the Tetromino T into the remaining empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

As we can see, Variation 1 of the Tetromino T fits perfectly into the remaining space without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino T is:

A. 1
