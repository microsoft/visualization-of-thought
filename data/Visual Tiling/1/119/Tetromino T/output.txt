First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have a total of 8 empty squares to fill with the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). The Tetromino I occupies 4 squares, and so does the Tetromino T.

Let's start with the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) since it has only two variations and is more restrictive due to its shape. We can see that the only place we can fit the Tetromino I is in the bottom row, as a horizontal line (Variation 2), because the vertical line (Variation 1) would not fit anywhere in the rectangle without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

So, we place the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) in the bottom row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have to fit the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). We have two variations to consider, but since we've already placed the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦), we can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨) will not fit in the remaining empty squares. However, Variation 3 of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨) will fit perfectly in the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino T to fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares is:
