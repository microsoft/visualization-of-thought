Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided variations of the polyominoes.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨).

Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨

We can see that the bottom row of the target rectangle has 4 consecutive empty squares, which matches the shape of Tetromino I Variation 2 (horizontal). This is the only place where this variation can fit because the other empty spaces are not in a straight line of four squares.

Let's place Tetromino I Variation 2 (horizontal) in the bottom row:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have to fit Tetromino T into the remaining empty squares. We can see that the remaining empty squares form a T shape, which matches the shape of Tetromino T. We can place Tetromino T in the remaining empty squares without needing to consider its variations, as the shape of the empty spaces dictates the orientation.

The final configuration is:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
B. 2
