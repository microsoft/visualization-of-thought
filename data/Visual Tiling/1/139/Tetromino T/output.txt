First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). We need to use their variations that allow only translation.

Let's start with Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥), which has two variations. Since there are four empty squares in a row at the top of the rectangle, we can use Variation 2 of Tetromino I to fill those squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

Now, we are left with three empty squares that need to be filled with Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). We have two variations of Tetromino T to consider. Let's visualize each variation to see which one fits:

Variation 2 of Tetromino T:
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ

Variation 3 of Tetromino T:
â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª

We can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T cannot fit into the remaining empty squares because it would require an empty square to the left of the bottom-most ğŸŸª, which does not exist in the target rectangle.

However, Variation 3 of Tetromino T can fit perfectly into the remaining empty squares with the following configuration:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the empty squares is Variation 3.

The answer is:
