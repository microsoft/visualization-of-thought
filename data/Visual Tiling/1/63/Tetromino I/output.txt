Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª).

Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 1:
â¬œğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
Variation 4:
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸªâ¬œ

We can see that the bottom row of the target rectangle has four consecutive empty squares, which matches the shape of Tetromino I Variation 2 (horizontal). This is the only place where Variation 2 of Tetromino I can fit, as the other empty spaces are not in a straight line of four squares.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I in the bottom row:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have three empty squares remaining in a T-shape, which perfectly matches the shape of Tetromino T Variation 1 or Variation 4. Since we are only asked to determine the correct variation of Tetromino I, we can conclude that Variation 2 is the correct one for Tetromino I.

The correct variation of Tetromino I is:
