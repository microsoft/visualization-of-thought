Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided variations of the polyominoes to determine which variation of Tetromino L can fit.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations for Tetromino L (ğŸŸ©) and two variations for Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¨).

Let's first try to fit the Tetromino I since it has a straight shape and can only fit in a row or a column with 4 consecutive empty squares. Looking at the target rectangle, we can see that there is only one place where Tetromino I can fit, which is the bottom row. We will use Variation 2 of Tetromino I to fill the bottom row.

After placing Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¨) in the bottom row, the target rectangle looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we have to fit Tetromino L (ğŸŸ©). We have two variations to choose from. Let's examine each variation to see which one can fit into the remaining empty squares.

Variation 3 of Tetromino L:
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ©
If we try to fit Variation 3 into the remaining empty squares, we can see that it cannot fit without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Variation 4 of Tetromino L:
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
Variation 4 can fit into the remaining empty squares on the left side of the rectangle. Let's place Variation 4 of Tetromino L into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we can fill in the remaining empty squares with Variation 4 of Tetromino L:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

The correct variation of Tetromino L that fits into the empty squares is Variation 4.

The answer is:
B. 4
