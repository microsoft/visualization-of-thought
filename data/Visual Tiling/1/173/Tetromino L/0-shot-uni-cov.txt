Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
🟥🟥🟥🟥
⬜⬜⬜🟪
⬜🟦🟪🟪
🟦🟦🟦🟪
⬜⬜⬜⬜
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino L (🟩)
2. Tetromino I (🟨)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 3 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟩🟩🟩
⬜⬜🟩
```
Variation 4 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟩🟩🟩
🟩⬜⬜
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟨
🟨
🟨
🟨
```
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟨🟨🟨🟨
```
-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (⬜), what's the correct variation of Tetromino L?
A. 3
B. 4
C. Neither
