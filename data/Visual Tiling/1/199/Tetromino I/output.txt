Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨).

The Tetromino I has two variations:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

The Tetromino L also has two variations:
Variation 1:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨

We need to fit these polyominoes into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's start with the Tetromino I. We can see that there is a row at the bottom with four consecutive empty squares, which matches the shape of Variation 2 of the Tetromino I. Variation 1 of Tetromino I cannot fit into the rectangle because there is no column with four consecutive empty squares.

So, we place Variation 2 of Tetromino I into the bottom row:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we need to fit the Tetromino L. Looking at the remaining empty squares, we can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino L can fit into the left side of the rectangle, filling the three vertical empty squares and one horizontal square on the second row from the top.

Let's place Variation 1 of Tetromino L into the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

All empty squares are now filled, and we have used Variation 2 of Tetromino I. Therefore, the correct answer is:
