Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided variations of the polyominoes to determine which variation of Tetromino I can fit.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We have two variations of Tetromino I:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

We also have two variations of Tetromino L that we can use:
Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
Variation 6:
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

Looking at the target rectangle, we can see that the Tetromino I must fit into a space of 4 squares in a row or column. Since there is no vertical space of 4 empty squares, we can only use Variation 2 (horizontal) of Tetromino I.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I in the only possible position:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Now, we need to fit one of the Tetromino L variations into the remaining empty squares. Variation 2 of Tetromino L cannot fit because it requires two squares on top of each other, which we do not have. However, Variation 6 of Tetromino L can fit perfectly into the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
B. 2
