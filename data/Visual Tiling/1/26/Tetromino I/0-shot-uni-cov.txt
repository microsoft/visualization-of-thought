Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
⬜⬜⬜⬜
🟩🟦🟦🟦
🟩⬜🟦🟪
🟩⬜🟪🟪
🟩⬜⬜🟪
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino I (🟥)
2. Tetromino L (🟨)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟥
🟥
🟥
🟥
```
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟥🟥🟥🟥
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟨🟨
⬜🟨
⬜🟨
```
Variation 6 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟨⬜
🟨⬜
🟨🟨
```
-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (⬜), what's the correct variation of Tetromino I?
A. 1
B. 2
C. Neither
