First, let's analyze the empty spaces in the target rectangle to determine where each polyomino could fit. We have two polyominoes to place: Tetromino T and Tetromino I. The Tetromino I can only fit in a straight line, either horizontally or vertically, and the Tetromino T needs to fit in a space where it can be placed without rotation or reflection.

Looking at the target rectangle, we can see that the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) can only fit in the bottom row, since it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares (â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ). Let's place the Tetromino I there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have to place the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ©). We have two variations to choose from, and we need to find a place where one of these variations can fit without rotation or reflection. The remaining empty squares form a shape that looks like this:

â¬œ
â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œ

This shape matches Variation 2 of the Tetromino T:

ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬œ

So, we can place Variation 2 of the Tetromino T in the remaining empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Filling in the last empty square with the Tetromino T:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the empty squares is:
