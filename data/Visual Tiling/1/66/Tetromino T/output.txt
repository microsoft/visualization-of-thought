First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify where the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) can fit. Since it's a straight line of four blocks, it can only fit in the first row of the target rectangle, which has four consecutive empty squares (â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ). We will use Variation 2 of Tetromino I to fill this row.

After placing Tetromino I, the target rectangle looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Now, we have three empty squares left to fill with the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). The Tetromino T must fit into the remaining empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The only place where Tetromino T can fit is in the bottom right corner, where there are three empty squares in a row and one empty square above the middle one.

Let's see which variation of Tetromino T can fit into this space:

Variation 1 of Tetromino T:
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
This variation cannot fit because the single square on top would go outside the rectangle.

Variation 4 of Tetromino T:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
This variation fits perfectly into the remaining empty squares, with the single square fitting into the empty square above the middle one.

So, after placing Variation 4 of Tetromino T, the target rectangle looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T to fit into the remaining empty squares is:
