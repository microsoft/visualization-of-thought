Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
🟥⬜⬜⬜
🟥🟨⬜🟪
🟥🟨🟨🟪
🟥🟨⬜🟪
⬜⬜⬜🟪
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino L (🟩)
2. Tetromino T (🟦)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 4 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟩🟩🟩
🟩⬜⬜
```
Variation 8 fitting into its bounding box:
```
⬜⬜🟩
🟩🟩🟩
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```
⬜🟦⬜
🟦🟦🟦
```
Variation 4 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟦🟦🟦
⬜🟦⬜
```
-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (⬜), what's the correct variation of Tetromino T?
A. 1
B. 4
C. Neither
