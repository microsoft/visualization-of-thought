Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the polyominoes provided.

Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino L and Tetromino T. Let's look at the variations of Tetromino L first, as it occupies four squares and there are only two possible places it can fit.

Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 4:
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
Variation 8:
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

We can see that Variation 4 of Tetromino L cannot fit into the rectangle because it would require two empty squares to be on top of each other, which is not the case in the target rectangle. However, Variation 8 can fit into the rectangle in the bottom left corner, filling the three empty squares in the bottom row and one in the row above.

Let's place Variation 8 of Tetromino L into the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
```

Now, we have three empty squares left in a T-shape, which matches the shape of Tetromino T. Let's look at the variations of Tetromino T to see which one fits.

Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 1:
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
Variation 4:
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œ

Variation 1 of Tetromino T cannot fit because it would require an empty square above the center of the T, which is not available. However, Variation 4 can fit perfectly into the remaining empty squares.

Let's place Variation 4 of Tetromino T into the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the remaining empty squares is:
