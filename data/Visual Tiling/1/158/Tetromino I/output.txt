Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª).

The Tetromino I has two variations:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

The Tetromino T has two variations provided:
Variation 2:
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª

We need to fit these polyominoes into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's start with the Tetromino T variations, as they have a unique shape that can help us determine where they might fit. Looking at the empty spaces, we can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T can fit into the bottom right corner of the rectangle, as it matches the pattern of empty squares there. Let's place it and see how it looks:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

Now, we have a single row of four empty squares left for the Tetromino I. Since Variation 1 of Tetromino I is vertical and would not fit into the remaining horizontal space, we must use Variation 2, which is horizontal.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I into the empty row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

All the empty squares are now filled without any overlaps or going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
