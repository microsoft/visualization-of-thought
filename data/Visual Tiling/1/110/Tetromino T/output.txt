First, let's look at the empty spaces in the target rectangle and determine where each polyomino could fit. We have a Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) that can fit in a straight line of 4 empty squares either horizontally or vertically, and a Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) that must fit in a configuration of 3 squares with one additional square adjacent to the middle square.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We can see that the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) can only fit in the bottom row, as it's the only place with 4 consecutive empty squares. Let's place it there:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we have to fit the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). We have two variations to choose from, but we can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T cannot fit in the remaining empty squares because it would require two empty squares on top of each other, which we do not have. Variation 3 of Tetromino T, however, can fit in the remaining space because it requires three squares in a column with one adjacent square in the middle, which matches the empty spaces we have left.

Let's place Variation 3 of Tetromino T in the remaining space:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the empty squares is:
