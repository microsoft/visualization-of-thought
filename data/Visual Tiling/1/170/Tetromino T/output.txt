First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify where the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) can fit. Since it's a straight line of four blocks, it can only fit in the first row or the fourth row, as these are the only places with four consecutive empty squares (â¬œ).

The Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) can be placed in the first row horizontally (Variation 2) like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, let's see where the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦) can fit. We have two variations to consider, but since we've placed the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) in the first row, the only place left for the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦) is in the third and fourth rows, where there are three empty squares in a row and one empty square directly above the middle one.

The Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦) can only fit in this space with Variation 1, which looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now we can place the remaining part of the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦) in the empty squares:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the target rectangle is:
