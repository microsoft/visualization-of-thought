First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

We have two polyominoes to fit: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦). The Tetromino I can be placed either vertically (Variation 1) or horizontally (Variation 2), and the Tetromino T has two variations provided (1 and 4), which are essentially the same shape but flipped vertically.

Let's start by trying to fit the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦) since it has a unique shape that can help us determine its position. We can see that there is only one place where the Tetromino T can fit without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we place the Tetromino T in the only possible position:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

With the Tetromino T placed, we can now look at where to fit the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥). We have two variations to choose from, but since the remaining empty squares form a straight line, we can only use Variation 2 (horizontal) of the Tetromino I:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino I to fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares is:
