Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨).

The Tetromino I has two variations:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

The Tetromino T has two variations provided:
Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨

We need to fit these polyominoes into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's start with the Tetromino T since it has a unique shape that can fit into specific spots. Looking at the empty squares, we can see that Variation 2 of the Tetromino T can fit into the left side of the rectangle, where there is a vertical line of three empty squares with one empty square to the right of the middle square. This is the only place where Variation 2 of the Tetromino T can fit.

Fitting Variation 2 of the Tetromino T into the rectangle:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
```

Now, we have four empty squares left in a horizontal line, which perfectly matches Variation 2 of the Tetromino I. Variation 1 of the Tetromino I cannot fit because it requires four vertical empty squares.

Fitting Variation 2 of the Tetromino I into the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
```

All the empty squares are now filled with the correct variations of the polyominoes. The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
