First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
```

We have a total of 8 empty squares to fill with the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). Since Tetromino I occupies 4 squares, it can only fit in a straight line either horizontally or vertically. We can see that there is only one place where Tetromino I can fit in its Variation 2 (horizontal):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
```

Now, we have 4 empty squares left to fit the Tetromino T. Let's look at the variations of Tetromino T:

Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ

Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨

We need to fit Tetromino T into the remaining empty squares. Variation 2 of Tetromino T cannot fit because it would require two empty squares on top of each other, which we do not have. Variation 3 of Tetromino T, however, can fit vertically into the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the empty squares is:
