First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨). We need to choose the correct variation for each that will fit into the empty squares without overlapping or going outside the rectangle.

Let's start with Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦), which has two variations:

Variation 1 (Vertical):
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦

Variation 2 (Horizontal):
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

Now, let's look at the empty spaces in the target rectangle. We have two distinct areas where we can potentially place the Tetromino I: the vertical column on the left and the horizontal row at the bottom.

The vertical column on the left has three empty squares, which is not enough for either variation of Tetromino I, which requires four squares. Therefore, we cannot use this column for Tetromino I.

The horizontal row at the bottom has four empty squares, which is the exact number of squares needed for either variation of Tetromino I. However, since we can only use translation and not rotation or reflection, we can only use Variation 2 (Horizontal) to fit into this space.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) in the bottom row:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have two remaining empty squares at the top, which perfectly match the shape of Variation 3 of Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨):

Variation 3 of Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨):
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨

Let's place Variation 3 of Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨) in the top right corner:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have one remaining empty square on the top left, which is part of the Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨) we just placed. The final configuration of the target rectangle is:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
