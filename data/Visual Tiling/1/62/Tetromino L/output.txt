Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the polyominoes provided.

The target rectangle with empty squares (â¬œ) looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨).

The Tetromino I can only fit in the bottom row of the rectangle because it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares. We will use Variation 2 of Tetromino I to fill the bottom row:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have three empty squares left in the top two rows. We need to fit the Tetromino L into these spaces. The only variation of Tetromino L that can fit into the remaining space without overlapping or going outside the rectangle is Variation 3. Variation 8 would not fit because it would require an empty square at the bottom of the L shape, which is not available.

Let's place Variation 3 of Tetromino L into the remaining space:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

All the empty squares are now filled without any overlaps or going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino L is:
