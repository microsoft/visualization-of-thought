First, let's visualize the target rectangle with the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦). We need to determine which variation of Tetromino I will fit.

Let's start by looking at the Tetromino T variations. We can see that the Tetromino T must fit into the two empty squares on the second row and one empty square on the first and third rows. The only way to fit the Tetromino T into these squares is by using Variation 2:

ğŸŸ¥â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥â¬œ

Placing this variation into the target rectangle, we get:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, we have four empty squares left at the bottom row for the Tetromino I. Since Tetromino I has only two variations (a vertical line and a horizontal line), and we need to fill a horizontal space, we must use Variation 2 of Tetromino I:

ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

Placing this variation into the target rectangle, we get the final configuration:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
