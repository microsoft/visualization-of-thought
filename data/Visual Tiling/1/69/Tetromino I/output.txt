To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which variation of the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) can fit into the empty squares without overlapping the existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. We also need to ensure that there is space for the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨) to fit.

Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

We have a horizontal space of four squares on the second row, which matches the shape of Variation 2 of the Tetromino I. Variation 1 of Tetromino I is a vertical line of four squares, which cannot fit anywhere in the rectangle without overlapping or going outside the rectangle.

Let's try placing Variation 2 of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©) in the second row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Now, we have a T-shaped space left for the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨), which matches Variation 1 or Variation 4 of Tetromino T. We can place either variation in the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

And then complete it with the last block of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Finally, we place the last block of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:

B. 2
