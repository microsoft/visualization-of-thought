Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (â¬œ) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©)
2. Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
```
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```
Variation 4 fitting into its bounding box:
```
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```
-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (â¬œ), what's the correct variation of Tetromino T?
A. 1
B. 4
C. Neither
