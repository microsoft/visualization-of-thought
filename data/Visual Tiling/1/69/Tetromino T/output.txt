First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). The Tetromino I can only fit in the four empty squares in the second row since it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares either horizontally or vertically. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Now we have to fit the Tetromino T. We have two variations to choose from, but since we only have three empty squares left in a single row, we can only use Variation 4, which fits into a single row with a protrusion in the middle. Let's place it:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Now we place the middle part of the T:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the remaining empty squares is Variation 4. So the answer is:

B. 4
