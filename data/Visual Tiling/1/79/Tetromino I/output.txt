Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided variations of the polyominoes to determine how they might fit.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨).

The Tetromino I has two variations:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

The Tetromino L has two variations provided:
Variation 5:
â¬œğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
Variation 6:
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

We can see that the bottom row of the target rectangle has 4 consecutive empty squares, which perfectly matches the horizontal Variation 2 of the Tetromino I. Let's place it there:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have three empty squares remaining in a shape that matches Variation 6 of the Tetromino L. Let's place it:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

All the empty squares are now filled with the provided polyominoes, and we used Variation 2 of the Tetromino I. Therefore, the correct answer is:
