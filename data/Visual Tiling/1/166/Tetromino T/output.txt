First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œ (1)
â¬œğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œ (2, 3, 4)
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ (5, 6, 7, 8)
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

We have 8 empty squares to fill with the Tetromino L and Tetromino T. Each tetromino covers 4 squares, so we need to use one of each to fill the empty spaces.

Let's start with the Tetromino L variations, as they have a more distinct shape that can fit into corners. We have two variations to choose from:

Variation 7:
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

Variation 8:
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

Looking at the target rectangle, we can see that Variation 7 of Tetromino L can fit into the bottom left corner, covering squares 5, 6, 7, and 2:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we have the following empty squares left: 1, 3, 4, and 8.

Next, let's look at the Tetromino T variations:

Variation 2:
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ

Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª

We need to fit one of these variations into the remaining empty squares. Variation 2 of Tetromino T cannot fit because it would require two empty squares to be vertically aligned, which is not the case in our remaining empty squares. However, Variation 3 can fit horizontally across squares 1, 3, 4, and vertically down into square 8:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the remaining empty squares is:
