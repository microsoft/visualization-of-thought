Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares looks like this:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨).

Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 3:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨
Variation 7:
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

We need to fit these polyominoes into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's start with the Tetromino I. We have two possible orientations for it: vertical (Variation 1) and horizontal (Variation 2). If we try to fit the vertical variation (Variation 1) into the rectangle, we can see that it won't fit because there are no four consecutive vertical empty squares. Therefore, Variation 1 is not the correct variation.

Now let's try Variation 2, the horizontal Tetromino I. It can fit perfectly into the top row of empty squares, like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Now we have the Tetromino L left to fit into the remaining empty squares. We can see that Variation 3 of Tetromino L will not fit into the remaining space because it would require two empty squares to the right of a single empty square, which we do not have. However, Variation 7 will fit perfectly into the remaining space, like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

So the correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
