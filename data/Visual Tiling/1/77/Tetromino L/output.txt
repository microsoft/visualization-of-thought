Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the polyominoes provided.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino T (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨).

The variations for Tetromino T are:
Variation 1:
â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
Variation 2:
ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬œ

The variations for Tetromino L are:
Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
Variation 5:
â¬œğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

We need to fit these polyominoes into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's start with Tetromino T since it has a unique shape that can only fit in one way given the constraints of translation only (no rotation or reflection). Looking at the empty spaces, we can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino T fits perfectly in the top left corner of the empty space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have the following empty spaces left for Tetromino L:
â¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ

Looking at the variations of Tetromino L, Variation 2 will not fit because it is too tall for the remaining space. However, Variation 5 fits perfectly into the remaining space:

â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

So, the correct variation of Tetromino L that fits into the remaining space is Variation 5. The final configuration would look like this:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Therefore, the answer is:
