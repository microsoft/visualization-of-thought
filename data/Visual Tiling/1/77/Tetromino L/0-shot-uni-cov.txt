Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (â¬œ) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino T (ğŸŸ©)
2. Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```
â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬œ
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
```
Variation 5 fitting into its bounding box:
```
â¬œğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```
-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (â¬œ), what's the correct variation of Tetromino L?
A. 2
B. 5
C. Neither
