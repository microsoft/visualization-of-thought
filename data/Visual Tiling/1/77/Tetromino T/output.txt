Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided variations of the polyominoes to determine which variation of Tetromino T can fit.

Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have two variations of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ©) and two variations of Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨) to consider.

Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 1:
â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
Variation 2:
ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬œ

Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
Variation 5:
â¬œğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

We need to fit these variations into the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's try to fit Tetromino T Variation 1 first:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```
This doesn't work because it leaves an isolated empty square that cannot be filled by any of the L variations.

Now let's try Tetromino T Variation 2:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```
This variation fits perfectly, leaving a 2x2 space that can be filled by one of the L variations.

Now we need to fit one of the L variations into the remaining space. Variation 2 of Tetromino L fits perfectly:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the target rectangle is:
B. 2
