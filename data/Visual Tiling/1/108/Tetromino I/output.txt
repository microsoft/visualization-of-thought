Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes.

Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦).

The Tetromino I can be placed either vertically (Variation 1) or horizontally (Variation 2). The Tetromino T can be placed in the shape of a T with the stem pointing down (Variation 1) or up (Variation 4).

Let's consider the Tetromino I first. If we use Variation 1 (vertical), we would not be able to fit it into the rectangle without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The only place it could potentially fit is in the bottom row, but that would leave no space for the Tetromino T.

Therefore, we must use Variation 2 (horizontal) for Tetromino I. Let's place it in the rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we have a single space left for the Tetromino T, which can only fit in one way without rotation or reflection. We'll use Variation 1 for Tetromino T, with the stem pointing down:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

And finally, we complete the placement of Tetromino T:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
