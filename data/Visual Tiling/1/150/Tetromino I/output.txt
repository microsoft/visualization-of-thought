Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸª).

The Tetromino I has two variations:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

The Tetromino L has two variations as well, but since we can only translate (not rotate or reflect), we can consider only one of them because the other would be a rotation of the first. Let's consider Variation 1:
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªâ¬œ

Now, let's try to fit the Tetromino I into the rectangle. We can immediately see that Variation 2 (horizontal) of Tetromino I cannot fit into the rectangle because there is no horizontal space of 4 consecutive empty squares. Therefore, we must use Variation 1 (vertical) of Tetromino I.

Let's place Variation 1 of Tetromino I into the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we have a space that perfectly fits the Tetromino L Variation 1:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

All the empty squares are now filled, and we have used Variation 1 of Tetromino I. Therefore, the correct answer is:
