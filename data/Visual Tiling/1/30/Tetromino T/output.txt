First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). The Tetromino I can only fit in the vertical orientation (Variation 1) because there is no horizontal space of 4 consecutive empty squares. Let's place the Tetromino I:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

Now, we have to fit the Tetromino T. We have two variations to choose from, but we can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) will not fit into the remaining empty squares because it requires two empty squares on top of each other, which we do not have. Let's visualize Variation 2 to confirm:

Variation 2:
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ

The remaining empty squares in the target rectangle do not accommodate this shape. However, Variation 3 of Tetromino T looks like it could fit into the remaining space:

Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª

Let's place Variation 3 of Tetromino T into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

As we can see, Variation 3 of Tetromino T fits perfectly into the remaining space. Therefore, the correct answer is:
