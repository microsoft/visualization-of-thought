First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). The Tetromino I can only fit in the second row horizontally because it's a 4-block straight line and that's the only place with 4 consecutive empty squares. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

Now, we have three empty squares left, which must be filled by the Tetromino T. The Tetromino T has two variations that we can use, but since we cannot rotate or reflect the pieces, we must choose the variation that fits the remaining empty squares as they are.

Let's visualize the two variations of Tetromino T:

Variation 2:
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ

Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª

We can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T cannot fit into the remaining empty squares because it would require a vertical line of three empty squares, which we do not have. However, Variation 3 of Tetromino T can fit into the remaining empty squares if we place it with the single block on the top right. Let's place Variation 3 into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the remaining empty squares is Variation 3.

The answer is:
