To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which variation of the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) can fit into the empty squares (â¬œ) of the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. We also need to ensure that there is space for the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) to fit.

Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

We have a horizontal space of 4 empty squares (â¬œ) on the second row, which matches the shape of Variation 2 of the Tetromino I. Let's try placing Variation 2 of the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©) in that space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

Now, we need to see if the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) can fit into the remaining empty squares. We have two variations of Tetromino T to consider, but we can immediately see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T will not fit because it requires two empty squares above each other, which we do not have. Variation 3 of Tetromino T also will not fit because it requires two empty squares below each other.

However, we have made an error in our reasoning. We have not been given Variation 1 of Tetromino T, which is the only variation that fits horizontally. Since we have not been given this variation, we cannot use it, and thus we must use Variation 2 of Tetromino T, which fits vertically. Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino T in the remaining empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

Now we have successfully placed both polyominoes into the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
