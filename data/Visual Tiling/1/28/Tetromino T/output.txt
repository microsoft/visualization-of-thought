First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify where the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) can fit. Given the variations of Tetromino I, we can see that it can only fit in the vertical column of four empty squares on the left side of the rectangle. Let's place the Tetromino I there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

Now, we have a 3x2 area of empty squares remaining. The Tetromino T must fit into this space. Let's try both variations of Tetromino T to see which one fits.

Variation 1 of Tetromino T:
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
This variation cannot fit into the remaining space because it would require a 3x2 area with the middle square of the top row being empty, which is not the case.

Variation 4 of Tetromino T:
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œ
This variation can fit into the remaining space because it matches the shape of the empty area. Let's place Variation 4 of Tetromino T into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the remaining space is Variation 4. Therefore, the answer is:

B. 4
