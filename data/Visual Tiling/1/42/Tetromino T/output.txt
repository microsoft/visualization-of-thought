First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit: Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦). Let's start with Tetromino I since it has fewer variations and is easier to place.

Variations for Tetromino I:
- Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
- Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

We can see that the only place we can fit the Tetromino I is in the bottom row of the target rectangle, since it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares. We'll use Variation 2 (horizontal) for Tetromino I:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, let's look at the variations for Tetromino T:

Variations for Tetromino T:
- Variation 1:
â¬œğŸŸ¥â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
- Variation 4:
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¥â¬œ

We need to fit Tetromino T into the remaining empty squares. We can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino T cannot fit because it would require two empty squares above a single empty square, which is not available. However, Variation 4 can fit perfectly into the three empty squares at the top and the single empty square in the second row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the empty squares is:

B. 4

The final configuration of the target rectangle with all polyominoes placed is:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```
