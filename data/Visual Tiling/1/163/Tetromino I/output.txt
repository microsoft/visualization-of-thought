First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify where each polyomino could potentially fit. We have a Tetromino T and a Tetromino I to place.

The Tetromino T has two variations provided, but we can see that only one of them will fit in the target rectangle without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The Tetromino T needs to be placed in a way that covers three squares in a row with one square adjacent to the middle of these three.

Looking at the target rectangle, we can see that the Tetromino T can only fit in the top two rows, because that's the only place with three consecutive empty squares (â¬œ) horizontally with an empty square (â¬œ) below the middle one. This corresponds to Variation 4 of the Tetromino T.

Let's place Variation 4 of the Tetromino T in the target rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, we have four empty squares (â¬œ) left in the bottom row. The Tetromino I has two variations: a vertical line (Variation 1) and a horizontal line (Variation 2). Since we have a single row of four empty squares, the only way the Tetromino I can fit is in its horizontal orientation, which is Variation 2.

Let's place Variation 2 of the Tetromino I in the target rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

All the empty squares (â¬œ) are now filled with the provided polyominoes, and the correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
