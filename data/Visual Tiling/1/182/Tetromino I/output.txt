Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle with empty squares (â¬œ) looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨).

Variations for Tetromino I:
ğŸŸ¦    ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦    (Variation 1)
ğŸŸ¦    (Variation 2)
ğŸŸ¦

Variations for Tetromino T:
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ    ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨    â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
(Variation 1) (Variation 4)

We need to fit these polyominoes into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's start with the Tetromino I. We have two variations to choose from. Variation 1 is vertical, and Variation 2 is horizontal.

If we try to fit Variation 1 (vertical) into the rectangle, we can see that it won't fit because there are no four consecutive vertical empty squares. Therefore, Variation 1 is not the correct variation for Tetromino I.

Now let's try Variation 2 (horizontal) of Tetromino I. We can see that it fits perfectly into the bottom row of empty squares.

So, the correct variation of Tetromino I is:
B. 2

After placing Variation 2 of Tetromino I, the target rectangle looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we only have the Tetromino T left to fit into the remaining three empty squares. Since we can only translate and not rotate or reflect, we must use Variation 1 of Tetromino T, which fits perfectly into the remaining space.

The final configuration of the target rectangle is:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

All polyominoes are now placed without overlapping or going outside the rectangle.
