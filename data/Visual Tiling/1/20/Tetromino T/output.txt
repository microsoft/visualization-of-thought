First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦). Let's start with Tetromino I since it has only two variations and is easier to place.

Variations for Tetromino I:
ğŸŸ©    ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©

We can see that the only place we can fit the Tetromino I is at the bottom row, since it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares. We'll use Variation 2 of Tetromino I:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, let's look at the remaining empty squares for Tetromino T:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

We have two variations for Tetromino T:

Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ

Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¦

We need to fit Tetromino T into the remaining empty squares. Variation 2 of Tetromino T cannot fit because it would require three empty squares in a vertical line, which we do not have. Variation 3 of Tetromino T also cannot fit because it would require three empty squares in a vertical line on the right side, which we do not have.

However, we need to consider that the variations provided may not include all possible translations of the Tetromino T. Since the variations allow only translation and not rotation or reflection, we can translate the given variations to fit the empty spaces.

If we translate Variation 2 of Tetromino T to the right by one square, we get:

â¬œğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¦

This translated variation can fit into the remaining empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the empty squares is:

A. 2 (after translating it to the right by one square)

The final configuration is:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```
