First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino L (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦). We need to choose the correct variation for each that will fit into the empty squares without overlapping or going outside the rectangle.

Let's start with the Tetromino L variations. We have two variations to choose from:

Variation 7:
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

Variation 8:
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

We can see that Variation 7 will not fit into the rectangle without overlapping the existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. However, Variation 8 can fit into the top left corner of the empty space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we have a 4x1 space left at the bottom, which perfectly matches one of the Tetromino I variations. Let's see which one:

Variation 1:
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦

Variation 2:
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

Variation 1 is a vertical column, and it cannot fit into the horizontal space we have left. Variation 2, however, is a horizontal line of four blocks, which fits perfectly into the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is Variation 2.
