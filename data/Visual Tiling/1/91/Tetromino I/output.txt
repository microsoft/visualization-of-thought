To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which variation of the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) can fit into the empty squares (â¬œ) of the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. We also need to ensure that there is space for the Tetromino L (ğŸŸª) to fit.

Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two options for the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥): a vertical line (Variation 1) or a horizontal line (Variation 2).

If we try to fit Variation 1 (vertical line) of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) into the rectangle, we would need a column with four consecutive empty squares. However, there is no such column available in the target rectangle.

Now let's try Variation 2 (horizontal line) of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
```

This variation fits perfectly into the top row of the target rectangle. Now we need to check if there is space for the Tetromino L (ğŸŸª) to fit into the remaining empty squares.

We have two variations for the Tetromino L (ğŸŸª), but we only need to find a place for one of them. Let's try Variation 1 of Tetromino L (ğŸŸª):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Variation 1 of Tetromino L (ğŸŸª) fits perfectly into the remaining empty squares. Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino I is:

B. 2

The final configuration of the target rectangle is:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

This configuration fits all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.
