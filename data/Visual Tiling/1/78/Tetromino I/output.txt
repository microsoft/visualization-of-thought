First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œ (1)
â¬œğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œ (2)
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ (3)
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ (4)
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have 8 empty squares to fill with the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino I (ğŸŸª). The Tetromino T occupies 4 squares, and the Tetromino I also occupies 4 squares.

Let's consider the variations of Tetromino T:

Variation 2:
ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬œ

Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œğŸŸ©

We can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T cannot fit into the target rectangle because it would require a vertical line of three empty squares, which we do not have. Variation 3 of Tetromino T, however, can fit into the rectangle in the leftmost column, as it matches the pattern of empty squares there.

Let's place Variation 3 of Tetromino T into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have only one empty square left in the second column and three consecutive empty squares in the first column. The only variation of Tetromino I that can fit into this remaining space is Variation 1, which is the vertical one:

Variation 1 of Tetromino I:
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª

Let's place Variation 1 of Tetromino I into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

All the empty squares are now filled without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
