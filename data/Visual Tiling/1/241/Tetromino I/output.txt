First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ©). We need to find the correct variation for Tetromino I that will fit into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's consider the variations for Tetromino I:

Variation 1 (Vertical):
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥

Variation 2 (Horizontal):
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

Now, let's look at the variations for Tetromino T:

Variation 2:
ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬œ

Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
â¬œğŸŸ©

We can see that the Tetromino T variations can only fit in the two vertical empty spaces on the left side of the rectangle. This is because the horizontal space is not long enough to accommodate the Tetromino T without overlapping the existing ğŸŸ¨ and ğŸŸª polyominoes.

Given this, we can place Tetromino T (Variation 2 or 3) in the leftmost column:

```
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
```

or

```
â¬œğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
```

Now, we have a horizontal space of four empty squares at the top of the rectangle. This is the perfect fit for Tetromino I Variation 2 (Horizontal):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
```

or

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is Variation 2 (Horizontal). Therefore, the answer is:
