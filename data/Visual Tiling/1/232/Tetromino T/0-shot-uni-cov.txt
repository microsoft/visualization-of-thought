Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
🟥🟥🟥🟥
🟩🟩🟩🟩
🟦⬜⬜⬜
🟦🟦⬜⬜
🟦⬜⬜⬜
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino L (🟨)
2. Tetromino T (🟪)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```

```
Variation 4 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟪🟪🟪
⬜🟪⬜
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 4 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟨🟨🟨
🟨⬜⬜
```
Variation 8 fitting into its bounding box:
```
⬜⬜🟨
🟨🟨🟨
```
-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (⬜), what's the correct variation of Tetromino T?
A. 2
B. 4
C. Neither
