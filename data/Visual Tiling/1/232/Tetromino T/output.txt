Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided variations of the polyominoes to determine which variation of Tetromino T can fit.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations of Tetromino T to consider:

Variation 2:
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ

Variation 4:
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸªâ¬œ

We also have two variations of Tetromino L:

Variation 4:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ

Variation 8:
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

Now, let's try to fit the Tetromino T variations into the target rectangle. We need to find a place where either variation 2 or variation 4 can fit without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Looking at the empty spaces, we can see that variation 2 of Tetromino T cannot fit because it is too tall for the available space. The empty spaces are only three squares high, and variation 2 requires four squares in height.

Variation 4 of Tetromino T, however, can fit horizontally in the second and third rows from the bottom, where there is a space three squares wide and two squares high, which matches the dimensions of variation 4 when the single square is placed in the middle column.

Let's place variation 4 of Tetromino T in the target rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, we have a 3x2 space left for Tetromino L, which perfectly fits either variation 4 or variation 8 of Tetromino L. We can choose either one, as they are mirror images of each other and we are not allowed to rotate or reflect. Let's choose variation 4 for this example:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the target rectangle is:
