Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the Tetromino T and L provided.

The target rectangle with empty squares (â¬œ) looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations for Tetromino T (ğŸŸª):
Variation 2:
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
Variation 4:
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸªâ¬œ

And two variations for Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨):
Variation 4:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
Variation 8:
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

We need to fit these variations into the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's start by trying to fit the Tetromino T variations, as they have a more complex shape and will be more restrictive in where they can be placed.

Looking at the target rectangle, we can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T cannot fit into the empty spaces because it is too tall. However, Variation 4 can fit horizontally in the second row from the bottom, where there are three consecutive empty squares and one empty square above the middle one.

Let's place Variation 4 of Tetromino T into the target rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, we have two empty squares left, and they are in an L-shape. We need to fit one of the Tetromino L variations into these two empty squares plus the two squares that are part of the existing polyominoes.

Looking at the two variations of Tetromino L, Variation 4 cannot fit because it would require an additional empty square at the bottom of the L-shape. However, Variation 8 can fit perfectly into the remaining empty squares, with the single square of the L fitting into the empty square on the bottom row and the three-square part of the L fitting into the second row from the bottom.

Let's place Variation 8 of Tetromino L into the target rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

All the empty squares are now filled, and we have used Variation 8 of Tetromino L. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. 8
