First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the possible placements for the Tetromino T variations. We have two variations of Tetromino T to consider:

Variation 1:
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

Variation 4:
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œ

We need to place one of these variations into the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. Let's try to fit each variation.

For Variation 1 of Tetromino T, we can see that it cannot fit into the rectangle because it would require two empty squares above a single empty square, which is not available in the target rectangle.

For Variation 4 of Tetromino T, it can fit into the rectangle in the following way:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, let's look at the remaining empty squares and see which variation of Tetromino L can fit:

Variation 1:
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªâ¬œ

Variation 5:
â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸª

We can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino L cannot fit because it requires three consecutive empty squares vertically with two squares at the top, which is not available in the target rectangle.

However, Variation 5 of Tetromino L can fit perfectly into the remaining empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino L that fits into the target rectangle is:
