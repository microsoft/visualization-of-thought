Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ©).

Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 4:
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
Variation 8:
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

We need to fit these polyominoes into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Let's start with the Tetromino I. We have two variations: one horizontal and one vertical. The target rectangle has a row with four consecutive empty squares at the top and no column with four consecutive empty squares. Therefore, we must use Variation 2 (horizontal) for Tetromino I.

After placing Tetromino I (Variation 2) in the top row, the target rectangle looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we have to fit Tetromino L. We have two variations to choose from, but since there are only four empty squares left, and they form an L shape that matches Variation 4 of Tetromino L, we must use Variation 4.

After placing Tetromino L (Variation 4) in the remaining empty squares, the target rectangle looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
