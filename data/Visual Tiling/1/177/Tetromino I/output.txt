First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify where each polyomino could potentially fit. We have two types of polyominoes to place: Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©). We need to find a place for each where they do not overlap with existing polyominoes or go outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Let's start with the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¥) because it has a more complex shape and fewer options for placement. We have two variations for the Tetromino T, but we only need to use one of them. Looking at the empty spaces, we can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T fits perfectly in the top left corner of the rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have a 4x1 space at the bottom row, which is perfect for Variation 2 of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©). Variation 1 of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) would not fit in the remaining space because it is a vertical piece and there is no 4x1 vertical space left. Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino I to fit into the remaining space is Variation 2.

The final configuration would look like this:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

So the answer is:
