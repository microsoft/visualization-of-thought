Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the polyominoes provided.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨) and Tetromino I (ğŸŸª).

The variations for Tetromino L are:
Variation 1:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
Variation 5:
â¬œğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

The variations for Tetromino I are:
Variation 1:
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª
ğŸŸª
Variation 2:
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª

We need to fit these polyominoes into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. Let's start by trying to fit the Tetromino I since it has a simpler shape.

The Tetromino I can only fit in the vertical or horizontal direction. Looking at the empty spaces, we can see that there is no place where four consecutive empty squares are aligned horizontally. Therefore, we must use Variation 1 of Tetromino I, which is vertical.

Placing Variation 1 of Tetromino I into the rectangle, we get:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have to fit the Tetromino L. Looking at the remaining empty spaces, we can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino L cannot fit because it would require two empty squares horizontally next to each other at the bottom, which we do not have.

However, Variation 5 of Tetromino L can fit perfectly into the remaining space, as it matches the pattern of the empty squares. Placing Variation 5 of Tetromino L into the rectangle, we get:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino L to fit into the empty squares is:
