First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). The Tetromino I can be placed either vertically (Variation 1) or horizontally (Variation 2), and the Tetromino T has two variations provided, but we can only use translation, not rotation or reflection.

Let's start with the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) because it has a unique shape that can only fit in certain ways. Looking at the empty squares, we can see that there is only one place where the Tetromino T can fit without rotation or reflection:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸªâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have a 4x1 space left for the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©). Since the space is horizontal, we need to use Variation 2 of the Tetromino I, which is the horizontal variation:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

However, we can see that this does not fit correctly because the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) overlaps with the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). This means we need to reconsider the placement of the Tetromino T.

Let's try placing the Tetromino T in the only other possible configuration without rotation or reflection:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have a 4x1 space left at the bottom for the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©). This space is horizontal, so we can use Variation 2 of the Tetromino I, which is the horizontal variation:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

This fits perfectly without any overlaps or going outside the rectangle. Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino I to use is:
