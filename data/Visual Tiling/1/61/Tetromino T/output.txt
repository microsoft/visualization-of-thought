First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). The Tetromino I can only fit in the bottom row since it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares either horizontally or vertically. Let's place the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) in the bottom row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have three empty squares left to fill with the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). The only way to fit the Tetromino T into the remaining empty squares is to use Variation 1, which looks like this:

â¬œğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª

Let's place the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) Variation 1 into the remaining empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

As we can see, Tetromino T Variation 1 fits perfectly into the remaining empty squares. Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino T is:
