First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). We need to determine which variation of Tetromino I will fit.

Let's consider the variations of Tetromino I:

Variation 1 (Vertical):
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥

Variation 2 (Horizontal):
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

Now, let's look at the empty spaces in the target rectangle. We can see that there is no vertical column of four empty squares for Variation 1 of Tetromino I to fit into. However, there is a horizontal row of four empty squares at the top of the rectangle where Variation 2 of Tetromino I could fit.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, we need to fit Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨) into the remaining empty squares. We have two variations of Tetromino T to consider:

Variation 1 (T-shape):
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

Variation 4 (Upside-down T-shape):
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ

Looking at the remaining empty squares, we can see that Variation 4 of Tetromino T will fit perfectly into the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
