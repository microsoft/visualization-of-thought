Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and see how the provided polyominoes could fit.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). The Tetromino I occupies 4 squares and can be placed either horizontally or vertically. The Tetromino T also occupies 4 squares and has two variations that can fit into a 2x3 bounding box.

Let's consider the Tetromino T first. We can see that there is no way to fit the T variation 1 into the empty spaces without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. However, variation 4 of Tetromino T can fit into the bottom left corner of the rectangle:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

Now, we have a 4x1 space left for the Tetromino I. The only variation of Tetromino I that can fit into this space is variation 2, which is the horizontal one:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

So the correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
