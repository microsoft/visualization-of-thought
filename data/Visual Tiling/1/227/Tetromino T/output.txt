Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the polyominoes we have to work with.

The target rectangle with empty squares (â¬œ) looks like this:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). The Tetromino I can fit into the rectangle in either a horizontal or vertical orientation, while Tetromino T has two variations that can fit into a 2x3 bounding box.

Let's first try to fit the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥), since it's the simpler of the two. We have two variations to choose from:

Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥

Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

Looking at the target rectangle, we can see that the Tetromino I can only fit in the horizontal orientation (Variation 2) at the top row, because the vertical orientation (Variation 1) would not fit anywhere without overlapping existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

So, we place the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) in the top row:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, we only have the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) left to fit into the remaining empty squares. We have two variations to choose from:

Variation 1:
â¬œğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª

Variation 4:
ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸªâ¬œ

Looking at the remaining empty squares, we can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) will fit perfectly into the remaining space, as it matches the shape of the empty squares. Variation 4 would not fit because it would require an empty square above the center of the T, which is not available.

So, we place the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) Variation 1 into the remaining empty squares:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T to fit into the empty squares is:
