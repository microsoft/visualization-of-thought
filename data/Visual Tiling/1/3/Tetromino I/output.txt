Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided variations of the polyominoes to determine which variation of Tetromino I can be used to fill the empty spaces without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

We have two variations of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) to consider:

Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥

Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

We also have two variations of Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) to consider, but we will focus on Tetromino I first.

Looking at the target rectangle, we can see that there is no vertical space of 4 empty squares to accommodate Variation 1 of Tetromino I. Therefore, Variation 1 cannot be used.

Now let's consider Variation 2 of Tetromino I. There is a horizontal space of 4 empty squares in the top row of the target rectangle. This space can accommodate Variation 2 of Tetromino I.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I in the top row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we have one empty square left in the second row, which can be filled with one of the variations of Tetromino T. Since Tetromino T occupies 4 squares and we only have one empty square left, it's clear that the remaining Tetromino T must be placed in such a way that it overlaps with the existing polyominoes in the rectangle.

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle is Variation 2:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Since we were able to place Variation 2 of Tetromino I and Variation 2 of Tetromino T into the target rectangle without any issues, the correct answer for the variation of Tetromino I is:

B. 2
