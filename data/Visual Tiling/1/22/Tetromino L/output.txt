First, let's look at the empty spaces in the target rectangle and determine where each polyomino could fit. We have a Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and a Tetromino L (ğŸŸª) to place.

The Tetromino I can only fit in the bottom row since it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares (â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ). We'll use Variation 2 of the Tetromino I to fill this space.

After placing the Tetromino I, the target rectangle looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now we have three empty squares left to fill with the Tetromino L. The remaining empty squares form an L-shape, which matches the shape of our Tetromino L. However, we need to determine which variation fits.

Let's try Variation 1 of the Tetromino L:
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
This variation cannot fit because it would require an empty square below the two consecutive empty squares on the second row, which is not available.

Now let's try Variation 2 of the Tetromino L:
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª
This variation can fit because it matches the L-shape of the remaining empty squares.

Placing Variation 2 of the Tetromino L into the target rectangle, we get:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

All the empty squares are now filled without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino L is:
