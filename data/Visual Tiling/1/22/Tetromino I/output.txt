First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸª). We need to determine which variation of Tetromino I will fit.

Let's consider the variations for Tetromino I:

Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©

Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

Now, let's look at the variations for Tetromino L:

Variation 1:
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªâ¬œ

Variation 2:
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª

We can see that the bottom row of the target rectangle has four consecutive empty squares, which is a perfect fit for the horizontal variation (Variation 2) of Tetromino I. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we have three empty squares left in the target rectangle, which can only be filled by one of the Tetromino L variations. Since we can only translate (not rotate or reflect), we need to use Variation 1 of Tetromino L, which fits perfectly into the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
