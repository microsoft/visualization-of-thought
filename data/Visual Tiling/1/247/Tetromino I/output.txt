Let's start by looking at the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the polyominoes provided.

The target rectangle has a 4x1 empty space at the bottom and three single empty squares in the second, third, and fourth rows. We need to fit the Tetromino T and Tetromino I into these spaces.

The Tetromino T can fit into a 2x3 area, and the Tetromino I can fit into either a 1x4 or a 4x1 area.

Let's try to fit the Tetromino T first. We can see that the Tetromino T can only fit into the three single empty squares in the second, third, and fourth rows if we use Variation 4. This is because Variation 1 would not cover the single empty square in the fourth row.

So, let's place Tetromino T Variation 4 into the target rectangle:

```
游린游린游린游린
游릴游릳游릳游릱
游릴游릴游릳游릱
游릴游릱游릳游릱
拘럭샢拘럭샢
```

Now we have a 4x1 empty space at the bottom, which perfectly matches the shape of Tetromino I Variation 2. Let's place it there:

```
游린游린游린游린
游릴游릳游릳游릱
游릴游릴游릳游릱
游릴游릱游릳游릱
游릵游릵游릵游릵
```

All the empty squares are now filled, and we have used Tetromino I Variation 2. Therefore, the correct answer is:

B. 2
