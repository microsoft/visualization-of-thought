Let's start by visualizing the target rectangle and identifying the possible placements for each polyomino variation.

Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

We have two polyominoes to place: Tetromino T and Tetromino L. Let's consider the variations of Tetromino T first.

Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 1:
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
Variation 4:
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œ

We can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino T cannot fit into the target rectangle because it would require two empty squares above a single empty square, which is not available. However, Variation 4 can fit into the rectangle in the top row, with the single square of the T going into the second row. Let's place Variation 4 of Tetromino T into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, let's consider the variations of Tetromino L.

Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 5:
â¬œğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
Variation 6:
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨

We need to fit Tetromino L into the remaining empty squares. Variation 5 cannot fit because it would require three consecutive empty squares vertically with an additional square to the right of the bottom square, which is not available. However, Variation 6 can fit perfectly into the remaining empty squares, with the single square of the L going into the second column. Let's place Variation 6 of Tetromino L into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

The correct variation of Tetromino L that fits into the target rectangle is Variation 6.
