Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
🟥⬜⬜⬜
🟥⬜⬜🟪
🟥⬜🟪🟪
🟥⬜⬜🟪
🟩🟩🟩🟩
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino T (🟦)
2. Tetromino L (🟨)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```
⬜🟦⬜
🟦🟦🟦
```
Variation 4 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟦🟦🟦
⬜🟦⬜
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 5 fitting into its bounding box:
```
⬜🟨
⬜🟨
🟨🟨
```
Variation 6 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟨⬜
🟨⬜
🟨🟨
```
-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (⬜), what's the correct variation of Tetromino L?
A. 5
B. 6
C. Neither
