Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the provided polyominoes to determine how they might fit.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ©).

Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 4:
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
Variation 8:
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

Looking at the target rectangle, we can see that the Tetromino L must fit into the bottom left corner because that's the only place with an L shape that matches the variations of Tetromino L. We can't use Variation 8 because it would leave an empty square in the bottom left corner, so we must use Variation 4.

Let's place Variation 4 of Tetromino L into the target rectangle:
```
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

Now, we have a vertical line of four empty squares on the left side, which perfectly fits Variation 1 of Tetromino I. Variation 2 of Tetromino I cannot fit anywhere in the remaining empty spaces.

Let's place Variation 1 of Tetromino I into the target rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
A. 1

The final configuration of the target rectangle is:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
```

All polyominoes fit without overlapping or going outside the rectangle, and the solution is complete.
