Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the provided polyominoes.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª).

Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 2:
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª

We need to fit these polyominoes into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. Let's analyze the empty spaces:

- There is a horizontal space of four empty squares on the top row.
- There is a vertical space of three empty squares on the rightmost column, with an additional empty square on the second row.

Given these observations, we can deduce the following:

- Tetromino I must be placed horizontally on the top row because it's the only space that can accommodate four contiguous squares horizontally. This means we must use Variation 2 of Tetromino I.
- Tetromino T must be placed in the remaining empty squares on the right side. The only variation that fits this space without rotation or reflection is Variation 2.

Let's visualize the state after placing Tetromino I (Variation 2) on the top row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, let's place Tetromino T (Variation 2) in the remaining empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I to fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares is:
