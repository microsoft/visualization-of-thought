First, let's analyze the empty spaces in the target rectangle. We have two vertical spaces that are 3 squares high and one horizontal space that is 4 squares wide. The Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¥) can fit into one of the vertical spaces, and the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) must fit into the horizontal space.

Here's the target rectangle with the empty squares:

```
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, let's try to fit the Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¥) into one of the vertical spaces. We can use Variation 5 of the Tetromino L, which looks like this:

â¬œğŸŸ¥
â¬œğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥

Fitting Variation 5 of Tetromino L into the leftmost vertical space, we get:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

Now, we have a 4x1 horizontal space left at the bottom. The only Tetromino I variation that fits into a 4x1 space is Variation 2, which is a horizontal line of 4 squares. Variation 1 is a vertical line of 4 squares and cannot fit into the remaining space.

So, the correct variation of Tetromino I to fit into the remaining space is:

B. 2

Fitting Variation 2 of Tetromino I into the bottom space, we get the final configuration:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

All the provided polyominoes are now fitted into the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.
