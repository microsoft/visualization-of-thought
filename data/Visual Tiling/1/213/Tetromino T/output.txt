First, let's look at the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the polyominoes we have to work with. We need to fit the Tetromino T and Tetromino I into the empty spaces without overlapping or going outside the rectangle.

The Tetromino I can be placed either horizontally or vertically. Since there is a row with four consecutive empty squares at the bottom of the rectangle, it's clear that Variation 2 of Tetromino I (horizontal) will fit perfectly there.

Let's place the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¦) Variation 2 in the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we have three empty squares remaining in a shape that matches Variation 1 of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ©). Variation 4 of Tetromino T would not fit into the remaining space because it would require two squares on top of each other, which is not available.

Let's place the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ©) Variation 1 in the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

As we can see, Variation 1 of Tetromino T fits perfectly into the remaining space. Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino T to fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares is:
