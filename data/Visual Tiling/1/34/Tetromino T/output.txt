First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦). The Tetromino I can only fit in the leftmost column since it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares vertically. Let's place it there:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
```

Now, we have the Tetromino T to fit into the remaining empty squares. We have two variations to choose from, but we can see that Variation 1 will not fit because it requires two empty squares above or below the central part of the T, which we do not have. Variation 4, however, fits perfectly into the remaining space:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
```

Now we place the center of the T:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
```

And finally, we fill in the last empty square with the bottom part of the T:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
```

The correct variation of Tetromino T that fits into the target rectangle is:
