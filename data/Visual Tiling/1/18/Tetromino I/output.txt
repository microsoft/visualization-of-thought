Let's start by examining the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We need to fit the Tetromino I and Tetromino T into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares looks like this:
```
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

We have two variations of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and two variations of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨) to consider.

Let's first try to fit the Tetromino T, since it has a more complex shape and fewer options for placement. We can see that the Tetromino T can only fit in one place without overlapping the existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. That place is in the top left corner, with the following configuration:

```
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we have the following empty squares left for the Tetromino I:

```
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

We can see that the only way to fit the Tetromino I is by using Variation 2, which is the horizontal version of the Tetromino I. The vertical version (Variation 1) would not fit in the remaining space.

So, the correct variation of Tetromino I to fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares is:

B. 2

The final configuration of the target rectangle would look like this:

```
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```
