Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We have a Tetromino T and a Tetromino I to place, and we need to determine which variation of Tetromino I will fit.

First, let's look at the empty spaces in the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We can see that there is a 2x2 square of empty spaces in the bottom right corner, which is a perfect fit for the Tetromino T (Variation 1 or Variation 4). Let's place the Tetromino T in that position:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have three remaining empty squares that form a vertical line. This is a perfect fit for the Tetromino I Variation 1, which is a vertical line of four squares. Let's place the Tetromino I Variation 1 in that position:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

All the empty squares are now filled, and we have used Tetromino I Variation 1. The correct answer is:

A. 1
