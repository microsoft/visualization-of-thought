Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
🟥🟨🟨⬜
🟥🟥🟨⬜
🟥⬜🟨⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬜
🟦🟦🟦🟦
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino T (🟩)
2. Tetromino I (🟪)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino T:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```
⬜🟩⬜
🟩🟩🟩
```
Variation 4 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟩🟩🟩
⬜🟩⬜
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```

-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (⬜), what's the correct variation of Tetromino I?
A. 1
B. 2
C. Neither
