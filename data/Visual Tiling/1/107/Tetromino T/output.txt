First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
â¬œğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). The Tetromino I can only fit in the leftmost column since it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares either vertically or horizontally. Let's place the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we have to fit the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) into the remaining empty squares. We have two variations of Tetromino T to consider, but we can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino T will not fit because it requires two empty squares above each other on the right side, which we do not have. Let's visualize Variation 2 to confirm:

Variation 2:
ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸªâ¬œ

This variation cannot fit into the remaining empty squares because there is no place where we have two vertical empty squares with an empty square to the right of the middle one.

Now let's consider Variation 3 of Tetromino T:

Variation 3:
â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª

This variation can fit into the remaining empty squares because it matches the pattern of the empty squares. Let's place Variation 3 of Tetromino T (ğŸŸª) into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

As we can see, Variation 3 of Tetromino T fits perfectly into the remaining empty squares. Therefore, the correct answer is:
