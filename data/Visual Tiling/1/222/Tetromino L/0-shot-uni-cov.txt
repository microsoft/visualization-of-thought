Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
🟥🟦🟦🟦
🟥🟨🟦⬜
🟥🟨🟨⬜
🟥🟨⬜⬜
⬜⬜⬜⬜
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino I (🟩)
2. Tetromino L (🟪)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino I:
Variation 1 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟩
🟩
🟩
🟩
```
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟩🟩🟩🟩
```
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 2 fitting into its bounding box:
```
🟪🟪
⬜🟪
⬜🟪
```
Variation 5 fitting into its bounding box:
```

-------------------------

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (⬜), what's the correct variation of Tetromino L?
A. 2
B. 5
C. Neither
