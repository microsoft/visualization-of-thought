First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have a total of 8 empty squares to fill with the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸª). Since the Tetromino I occupies 4 squares and the Tetromino L also occupies 4 squares, they will perfectly fill the empty spaces.

Let's start with the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©), as it has only two variations and is simpler to place. We can see that the only way to place the Tetromino I without rotating or reflecting it is to use Variation 2, which is horizontal, because there is no vertical space of 4 empty squares. Placing the Tetromino I in the bottom row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

Now, we have to place the Tetromino L (ğŸŸª). We have two variations to choose from, and we need to fit it into the remaining 4 empty squares. Let's visualize each variation to see which one fits:

Variation 2:
ğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª

Variation 5:
â¬œğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸªğŸŸª

We can see that Variation 2 of Tetromino L cannot fit into the remaining space because it would require two empty squares to be on top of each other, which is not the case. However, Variation 5 can fit perfectly into the remaining space, with the single square of the L going into the single empty square on the third row and the bottom part of the L filling the remaining three squares on the fourth row.

Let's place Variation 5 of Tetromino L into the target rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
```

The correct variation of Tetromino L to fit into the empty squares is:
