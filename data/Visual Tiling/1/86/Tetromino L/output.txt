First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have a total of 8 empty squares to fill with the Tetromino I (4 squares) and Tetromino L (4 squares). Since the Tetromino I occupies 4 squares in a straight line, and we have a row and a column with exactly 4 empty squares, it's clear that the Tetromino I must occupy one of these lines.

Let's try placing the Tetromino I in the bottom row first, as it's the only place where Variation 2 of Tetromino I can fit:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have the remaining empty squares in the second and third rows to fill with the Tetromino L. We can see that only Variation 3 of Tetromino L can fit into the remaining space because it has the 'L' shape that can fill the two empty squares in the second row and extend down to fill the two empty squares in the third row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino L is:

A. 3

The final configuration of the target rectangle is:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```
