First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œğŸŸª
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦). We need to determine which variation of Tetromino I will fit.

Let's start by trying to fit Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¦) since it has a unique shape that might only fit in certain places. We can see that there is only one place where Tetromino T can fit without rotation or reflection, which is at the bottom left corner of the rectangle. Let's place it there:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
```

Now we have placed Tetromino T, and we are left with a 4x1 space at the top and a 2x1 space at the bottom right. Since Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) is a 4x1 polyomino, it can only fit in the 4x1 space at the top. Let's place Tetromino I there:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
```

We have successfully placed both polyominoes without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
