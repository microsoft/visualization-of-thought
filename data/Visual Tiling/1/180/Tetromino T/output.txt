First, let's visualize the target rectangle with the empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I and Tetromino T. Let's start by placing the Tetromino I, since it has only two variations and its placement is more restricted due to its shape.

The Tetromino I can only fit in the bottom row of the rectangle, as it's the only place with four consecutive empty squares. We'll use Variation 2 of Tetromino I to fill the bottom row:

```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have to place the Tetromino T. We have two variations to choose from, but we can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino T cannot fit in the remaining empty squares because it would require two empty squares horizontally next to each other with an empty square directly above the middle one, which is not available.

However, Variation 4 of Tetromino T can fit perfectly in the remaining empty squares, with the single block of the T going into the single empty square in the second row, and the three blocks of the T filling the three empty squares in the first row:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino T to fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares is:
