To solve this puzzle, we need to determine which variation of the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) can fit into the empty squares without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. Let's analyze the empty spaces to see which variation can fit.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have two variations of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©) to consider:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ©
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©

We also have two variations of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨) to consider:
Variation 1:
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
Variation 4:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ

Let's start with the Tetromino I (ğŸŸ©). We need to find a place where we can fit either a vertical or horizontal line of four squares. Looking at the target rectangle, we can see that there is no vertical space of four empty squares, so Variation 1 of Tetromino I cannot be used. However, there is a horizontal space of four empty squares at the bottom row. Therefore, Variation 2 of Tetromino I can fit into the rectangle.

Let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I into the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we need to place the Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨). We have two variations to consider, but since there are only three empty squares left in a row, we can only use Variation 1 of Tetromino T, which fits perfectly into the remaining space.

Let's place Variation 1 of Tetromino T into the rectangle:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
B. 2

The final state of the rectangle is:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```
