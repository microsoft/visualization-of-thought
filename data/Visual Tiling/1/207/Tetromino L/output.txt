First, let's look at the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the variations of the Tetromino I (ğŸŸª), since it's the simpler of the two polyominoes with only two variations: a vertical line and a horizontal line.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨â¬œ
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
```

We can see that there is no place where a horizontal Tetromino I (Variation 2) can fit because there is no row with four consecutive empty squares. Therefore, we must use the vertical Tetromino I (Variation 1).

Let's place the vertical Tetromino I (ğŸŸª) in the only possible position:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

Now, we have the following empty spaces left for the Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¦):
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

We can see that the only way to fit the Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¦) without overlapping or going outside the rectangle is to use Variation 6, which looks like this:
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦â¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

So, the correct variation of Tetromino L to fit into the empty squares is:
B. 6

The final configuration would be:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
```

This completes the task with all polyominoes fitting into the target rectangle without overlapping or going outside the rectangle.
