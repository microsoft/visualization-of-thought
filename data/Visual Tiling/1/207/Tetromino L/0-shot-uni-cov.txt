Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with 8 empty squares:
```
🟥🟥🟥🟥
🟩🟩🟩⬜
⬜🟩🟨⬜
⬜🟨🟨⬜
⬜⬜🟨⬜
```

Provided polyominoes:
1. Tetromino L (🟦)
2. Tetromino I (🟪)
-------------------------
Variations for Tetromino L:
Variation 5 fitting into its bounding box:
