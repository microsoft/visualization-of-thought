First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ) where we need to fit the polyominoes:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). The Tetromino I can only fit in the rectangle in its horizontal variation (Variation 2) because the vertical variation (Variation 1) is too tall for the space available. Let's place the Tetromino I in the only possible position:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we have to fit the Tetromino T (ğŸŸª). We have two variations to consider, but since we can only translate and not rotate or reflect, we need to find a place where the Tetromino T can fit without overlapping the existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

Looking at the remaining empty squares, we can see that Variation 1 of Tetromino T can fit perfectly in the bottom left corner:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

So the correct variation of Tetromino T to fit into the empty squares is:
