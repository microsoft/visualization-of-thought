First, let's look at the target rectangle and identify the empty squares (â¬œ):

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have two polyominoes to fit into this rectangle: Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and Tetromino L (ğŸŸ¨). Tetromino I can be placed either vertically (Variation 1) or horizontally (Variation 2), and Tetromino L can be placed in two different L-shaped configurations (Variations 3 and 4).

Let's start by trying to fit Tetromino I. We can immediately see that Variation 1 (vertical) will not fit into the rectangle because there is no column with four consecutive empty squares. Therefore, we must use Variation 2 (horizontal) for Tetromino I.

Now, let's place Variation 2 of Tetromino I into the rectangle:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

With Tetromino I placed, we now have three empty squares left in a shape that matches one of the Tetromino L variations. Let's see which one fits:

Variation 3 of Tetromino L:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œâ¬œğŸŸ¨

Variation 4 of Tetromino L:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ¨â¬œâ¬œ

We can see that Variation 3 of Tetromino L fits perfectly into the remaining empty squares:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Therefore, the correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
