Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided polyominoes. We need to fit the Tetromino I and Tetromino T into the empty spaces without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares looks like this:
```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations of Tetromino I (ğŸŸ¥) and two variations of Tetromino T (ğŸŸ¨).

Let's first try to fit the Tetromino T, since it has a unique shape that can only fit in certain ways. Looking at the empty spaces, we can see that the Tetromino T can only fit in the bottom left corner, using Variation 1:

```
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

Now, we have a 4x1 space left at the top, which perfectly fits Variation 2 of Tetromino I:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
```

So, the correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the empty squares is:
