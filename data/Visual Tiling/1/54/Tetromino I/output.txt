Let's start by examining the empty spaces in the target rectangle and the provided variations of the polyominoes to determine which variation of Tetromino I can be used to fill the empty spaces without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle.

The target rectangle with 8 empty squares is:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
â¬œâ¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
```

We have two variations of Tetromino I:
Variation 1 (vertical):
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
ğŸŸ¦
Variation 2 (horizontal):
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦

And two variations of Tetromino T:
Variation 1:
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
Variation 4:
ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
â¬œğŸŸ¨â¬œ

We need to fit these into the target rectangle. Let's start with Tetromino I since it has a simpler shape and fewer options for placement.

Looking at the target rectangle, we can see that the only place we can fit the 4-block Tetromino I is at the bottom row, since it's the only place with 4 consecutive empty squares. This means we must use Variation 2 (horizontal) of Tetromino I.

After placing Variation 2 of Tetromino I, the target rectangle looks like this:
```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©â¬œâ¬œâ¬œ
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©â¬œğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

Now, we only have the Tetromino T left to place. The remaining empty squares form a T shape, which matches Variation 1 of Tetromino T. Let's place it:

```
ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥ğŸŸ¥
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸ¨
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ©ğŸŸ¨ğŸŸª
ğŸŸ©ğŸŸªğŸŸªğŸŸª
ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦ğŸŸ¦
```

We have successfully placed all the polyominoes without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The correct variation of Tetromino I that fits into the target rectangle is:
