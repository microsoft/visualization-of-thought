To navigate from 🏠 to 🏢, we need to avoid the obstacles 🚧 and follow the continuous road ⬜. Here's the step-by-step navigation:

1. Move up from 🏠 to the end of the continuous road.
```
⬜⬜⬜
🏠🚧⬜
🏠🚧🏢
```

2. Move right from the current position to the end of the continuous road.
```
⬜⬜⬜
⬜🚧🏠
🏠🚧🏢
```

3. Move down from the current position to reach the destination 🏢.
```
⬜⬜⬜
⬜🚧⬜
🏠🚧🏠
```

The 🏠 at the destination indicates that we have reached the office. The correct path is up, right, and then down.
