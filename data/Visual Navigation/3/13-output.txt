To navigate from 🏠 to 🏢, we need to find the path that avoids the 🚧 obstacles and reaches the destination. Let's start by visualizing the initial state:

```
⬜⬜⬜🚧🚧
⬜🚧⬜🚧🚧
🏢🚧⬜⬜🏠
```

Starting at 🏠, the only initial move is to go left, as moving up would lead to an obstacle. Let's make that move:

Step 1: Move left to the end of the continuous road.

```
⬜⬜⬜🚧🚧
⬜🚧⬜🚧🚧
🏢🚧🏠⬜
```

Step 2: From here, the only option is to move up to avoid the obstacle.

```
⬜⬜⬜🚧🚧
⬜🚧🏠🚧🚧
🏢🚧⬜⬜
```

Step 3: Now, we can move left to reach the office 🏢.

```
⬜⬜⬜🚧🚧
🏠🚧⬜🚧🚧
🏢🚧⬜⬜
```

Step 4: Finally, move down to reach the destination.

```
⬜⬜⬜🚧🚧
⬜🚧⬜🚧🚧
🏠🚧⬜⬜
```

The steps to navigate from 🏠 to 🏢 are:

1. Move left.
2. Move up.
3. Move left.
4. Move down.

This sequence will take you from the home to the office without hitting any obstacles.
