To navigate from 🏠 to 🏢, we need to find the path that avoids obstacles 🚧 and follows the roads ⬜. Let's start by visualizing the map and then I'll guide you through each step.

Initial map:
```
🏢🚧⬜⬜🏠
⬜🚧⬜🚧🚧
⬜⬜⬜🚧🚧
```

Step 1: Move left from 🏠 to the end of the road.
```
🏢🚧⬜🚶⬜
⬜🚧⬜🚧🚧
⬜⬜⬜🚧🚧
```

Step 2: Move down to the bottom road.
```
🏢🚧⬜⬜⬜
⬜🚧⬜🚧🚧
⬜⬜🚶🚧🚧
```

Step 3: Move left to the first column.
```
🏢🚧⬜⬜⬜
⬜🚧⬜🚧🚧
🚶⬜⬜🚧🚧
```

Step 4: Move up to the top road, reaching the office 🏢.
```
🚶🚧⬜⬜⬜
⬜🚧⬜🚧🚧
⬜⬜⬜🚧🚧
```

You have now reached the office 🏢. The steps taken were: left, down, left, up.
