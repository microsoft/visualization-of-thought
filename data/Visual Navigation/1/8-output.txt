To navigate from 🏠 to 🏢, we need to find the path that avoids the obstacles (🚧) and follows the roads (⬜). Here's the step-by-step navigation:

1. Move right from 🏠 to the end of the continuous road.
```
🏠🚶⬜
🚧🚧⬜
🚧🚧🏢
```

2. Move down from the current position to the end of the continuous road, which is also the destination 🏢.
```
🏠⬜⬜
🚧🚧⬜
🚧🚧🚶
```

So the steps to navigate to 🏢 are:
- Right
- Down
