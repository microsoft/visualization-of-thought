To navigate from 🏠 to 🏢, we need to find the path that avoids obstacles (🚧) and follows the roads (⬜). Here's the step-by-step navigation:

1. Move down from 🏠 to the end of the continuous road.
```
🚧🚧🏠
🚧🚧⬜
🏢⬜⬜
```
After the move:
```
🚧🚧⬜
🚧🚧🏠
🏢⬜⬜
```

2. Move left from the current position to the office 🏢.
```
🚧🚧⬜
🚧🚧🏠
🏢⬜⬜
```
After the move:
```
🚧🚧⬜
🚧🚧⬜
🏠⬜⬜
```

The 🏠 has now reached the 🏢, completing the navigation task.
