To navigate from 🏠 to 🏢, we need to find the path that avoids the obstacles (🚧) and follows the roads (⬜). Here's the step-by-step navigation:

1. Move left from 🏠 to the end of the continuous road.
```
🏠⬜⬜
⬜🚧🚧
🏢🚧🚧
```
After moving left:
```
⬜🏠⬜
⬜🚧🚧
🏢🚧🚧
```

2. Move down from the current position to the end of the continuous road.
```
⬜⬜⬜
🏠🚧🚧
🏢🚧🚧
```

3. Move left from the current position to reach the destination 🏢.
```
⬜⬜⬜
⬜🚧🚧
🏠🚧🚧
```

The 🏠 has now reached the 🏢, and the navigation task is complete.
