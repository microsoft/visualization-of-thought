Let's first map out the grid based on the initial information provided:

```
ring-necked snake - airliner - Shetland Sheepdog
kimono - schooner - smooth green snake
common sorrel - jaguar - Newfoundland
```

Now, let's follow the instructions from the position of the jaguar:

1. Start at the jaguar (middle of the bottom row).
2. Go up by one step (to the schooner, middle of the middle row).
3. Go up by one step (to the airliner, middle of the top row).
4. Go right by one step (to the Shetland Sheepdog, right of the top row).
5. Go down by one step (to the smooth green snake, right of the middle row).
6. Go down by one step (to the Newfoundland, right of the bottom row).
7. Go left by one step (back to the jaguar, middle of the bottom row).

After following these steps, you end up back at the position of the jaguar.
