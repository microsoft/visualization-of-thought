Let's first map out the grid based on the information given:

```
Yorkshire Terrier - Leonberger - Minibus
Cannon - Dishwasher - Earth Star
Acoustic Guitar - Oboe - Chameleon
```

You start at the position where the Earth Star is located, which is in the middle of the right column.

Now, follow the instructions:

1. Go up by one step: You move from the Earth Star to the Dishwasher.
2. Go right by one step: You can't move right because you're already at the rightmost column, so you stay at the Dishwasher.
3. Go down by one step: You move from the Dishwasher to the Chameleon.
4. Go down by one step: You can't move down because you're already at the bottom row, so you stay at the Chameleon.
5. Go right by one step: You can't move right because you're already at the rightmost column, so you stay at the Chameleon.
6. Go left by one step: You move from the Chameleon to the Oboe.

After following all the steps, you will find the Oboe.

Answer: Oboe.
