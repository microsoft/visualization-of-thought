Let's first map out the grid based on the information given:

1. Start at the bottom-left corner with a king penguin.
2. Move right to find a brown bear.
3. Move right again to find an English foxhound.
4. Move up to find a hot pot.
5. Move left to find a hoop skirt.
6. Move left to find an eraser.
7. Move up to find a mop.
8. Move right to find a Norwich Terrier.
9. Move right to find a ground beetle.

The grid now looks like this:

```
| mop | Norwich Terrier | ground beetle |
| eraser | hoop skirt | hot pot |
| king penguin | brown bear | English foxhound |
```

Now, starting from the hoop skirt:

1. Move left by one step to find an eraser.
2. Move up by one step to find a mop.
3. Move right by one step to find a Norwich Terrier.
4. Move down by one step to find a hoop skirt again.

So, after following the instructions, you will find a hoop skirt.
