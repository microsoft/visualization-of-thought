You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a king penguin, then you go right, where you will find a brown bear, then you go right, where you will find an English foxhound. Then you go up, where you will find a hot pot, then you go left, where you will find a hoop skirt, then you go left, where you will find an eraser. Then you go up, where you will find a mop, then you go right, where you will find a Norwich Terrier, then you go right, where you will find a ground beetle. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the hoop skirt is located, then you go left by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go right by one step, and then you go down by one step. What will you find?
