Let's visualize the grid based on the items you've described:

```
+-------------------+
| Keyboard | Chestnut | Cricket |
+-------------------+
| Sloth    | Cheetah  | Snorkel |
+-------------------+
| Gas Mask | Burrito  | Drill   |
+-------------------+
```

You start at the bottom-left corner where the Gas Mask is located:

```
+-------------------+
| Keyboard | Chestnut | Cricket |
+-------------------+
| Sloth    | Cheetah  | Snorkel |
+-------------------+
| *Gas Mask | Burrito  | Drill   |
+-------------------+
```

Then you go up by one step (to the Sloth):

```
+-------------------+
| Keyboard | Chestnut | Cricket |
+-------------------+
| *Sloth    | Cheetah  | Snorkel |
+-------------------+
| Gas Mask | Burrito  | Drill   |
+-------------------+
```

Then you go right by one step (to the Cheetah):

```
+-------------------+
| Keyboard | Chestnut | Cricket |
+-------------------+
| Sloth    | *Cheetah  | Snorkel |
+-------------------+
| Gas Mask | Burrito  | Drill   |
+-------------------+
```

Then you go down by one step (to the Burrito):

```
+-------------------+
| Keyboard | Chestnut | Cricket |
+-------------------+
| Sloth    | Cheetah  | Snorkel |
+-------------------+
| Gas Mask | *Burrito  | Drill   |
+-------------------+
```

Then you go right by one step (to the Drill):

```
+-------------------+
| Keyboard | Chestnut | Cricket |
+-------------------+
| Sloth    | Cheetah  | Snorkel |
+-------------------+
| Gas Mask | Burrito  | *Drill   |
+-------------------+
```

Then you go up by one step (to the Snorkel):

```
+-------------------+
| Keyboard | Chestnut | Cricket |
+-------------------+
| Sloth    | Cheetah  | *Snorkel |
+-------------------+
| Gas Mask | Burrito  | Drill   |
+-------------------+
```

Finally, you go left by one step (to the Cheetah):

```
+-------------------+
| Keyboard | Chestnut | Cricket |
+-------------------+
| Sloth    | *Cheetah  | Snorkel |
+-------------------+
| Gas Mask | Burrito  | Drill   |
+-------------------+
```
