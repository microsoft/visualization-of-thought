Let's first map out the grid with the items you've described:

```
dugong - Basenji - meerkat
gong   - gas pump - knot
kite   - sombrero - screw
```

You start at the position where the kite is located, which is the bottom-left corner of the grid. Now, follow the instructions:

1. Go down by one step: You can't go down from the kite's position because you're already at the bottom row. So, you stay at the kite's position.
2. Go right by one step: You move to the cell with the sombrero.
3. Go right by one step: You move to the cell with the screw.
4. Go up by one step: You move to the cell with the knot.
5. Go up by one step: You move to the cell with the Basenji.
6. Go left by one step: You move to the cell with the dugong.
7. Go down by one step: You move to the cell with the gong.
8. Go right by one step: You move to the cell with the gas pump.

So, after following all the steps, you will find the gas pump.
