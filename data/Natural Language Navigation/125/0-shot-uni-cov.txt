You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a stinkhorn mushroom, then you go right, where you will find a tricycle, then you go right, where you will find an Australian Terrier. Then you go up, where you will find a dunlin, then you go left, where you will find a cornet, then you go left, where you will find a cello. Then you go up, where you will find a cuirass, then you go right, where you will find a spider web, then you go right, where you will find a West Highland White Terrier. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the cello is located, then you go right by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go left by one step, and then you go down by one step. What will you find?
