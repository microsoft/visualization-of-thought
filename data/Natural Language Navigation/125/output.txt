Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

1. Start at the bottom-left corner with a stinkhorn mushroom.
2. Move right to find a tricycle.
3. Move right to find an Australian Terrier.
4. Move up to find a dunlin.
5. Move left to find a cornet.
6. Move left to find a cello.
7. Move up to find a cuirass.
8. Move right to find a spider web.
9. Move right to find a West Highland White Terrier.

The grid now looks like this:

```
| cuirass | spider web | West Highland White Terrier |
| cello   | cornet     | dunlin                     |
| stinkhorn mushroom | tricycle | Australian Terrier |
```

Now, you start at the cello and follow the instructions:

1. Start at the cello.
2. Move right by one step to the cornet.
3. Move up by one step to the spider web.
4. Move left by one step to the cuirass.
5. Move down by one step to the cello again.

After following these steps, you end up back at the cello.
