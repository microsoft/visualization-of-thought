Let's first map out the grid based on the initial information provided:

```
maypole - English Setter - knot
crash helmet - chambered nautilus - weasel
clogs - hammerhead shark - safe
```

You start at the position where the chambered nautilus is located, which is the center of the grid.

1. Go up by one step: You arrive at the position of the crash helmet.
2. Go right by one step: You move to the position of the weasel.
3. Go down by one step: You are now at the position of the safe.
4. Go down by one step: This move is not possible because you are already at the bottom row of the grid. Therefore, you cannot move down further.

Since the last instruction cannot be followed, we will stop at the step before and determine what you find there.

Answer: You will find a safe.
