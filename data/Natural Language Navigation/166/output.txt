Let's first map out the grid based on the information given:

Starting from the bottom-left corner (the yurt), and moving right:
1. Yurt
2. Lacewing
3. Mobile Home

Moving up from the Mobile Home:
4. West Highland White Terrier
5. Space Bar
6. Hare

Moving up from the Hare:
7. Drumstick
8. Menu
9. Mantis

Now the grid looks like this:

```
Drumstick - Menu - Mantis
Hare - Space Bar - West Highland White Terrier
Yurt - Lacewing - Mobile Home
```

Now, starting from the position of the Lacewing, we follow the instructions:

1. Go up by one step: You arrive at the Space Bar.
2. Go left by one step: You arrive at the Hare.
3. Go up by one step: You arrive at the Drumstick.
4. Go right by one step: You arrive at the Menu.
5. Go down by one step: You arrive at the Space Bar again.

Answer: You will find a Space Bar.
