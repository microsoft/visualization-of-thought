Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

```
+---+---+---+
| O | T | C |
+---+---+---+
| P | T | S |
+---+---+---+
| C | S | C |
+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- C = Coil
- S = Sussex Spaniel
- C = Candle
- O = Otter
- T = Tractor
- P = Passenger car
- O = Oxygen mask
- T = Tench
- C = Coffeemaker

Now, let's follow the instructions given:

1. Start at the position where the coil is located (bottom-left corner).
2. Go right by one step (to the Sussex Spaniel).
3. Go right by one step (to the Candle).
4. Go up by one step (to the Otter).
5. Go up by one step (to the Oxygen mask).
6. Go left by one step (to the Tench).
7. Go left by one step (to the Tractor).
8. Go down by one step (to the Passenger car).
9. Go down by one step (back to the Coil).

After following these steps, we end up back at the starting position where the coil is located.

Answer: You will find a coil.
