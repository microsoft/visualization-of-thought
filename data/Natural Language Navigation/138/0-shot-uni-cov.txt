You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find an acoustic guitar, then you go right, where you will find a breastplate, then you go right, where you will find a pajamas. Then you go up, where you will find a red-breasted merganser, then you go left, where you will find an automated teller machine, then you go left, where you will find an electric locomotive. Then you go up, where you will find a wok, then you go right, where you will find a Granny Smith, then you go right, where you will find a window screen. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the automated teller machine is located, then you go left by one step, then you go down by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go up by one step, and then you go left by one step. What will you find?
