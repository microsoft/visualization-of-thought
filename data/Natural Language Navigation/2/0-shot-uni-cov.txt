You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a torch, then you go right, where you will find an infant bed, then you go right, where you will find an American dipper. Then you go up, where you will find a jay, then you go left, where you will find a terrapin, then you go left, where you will find a microwave oven. Then you go up, where you will find a baseball player, then you go right, where you will find a harvestman, then you go right, where you will find a neck brace. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the torch is located, then you go right by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go left by one step, then you go down by one step, and then you go down by one step.
