Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

```
+---+---+---+
| B | H | N |
+---+---+---+
| M | T | J |
+---+---+---+
| T | I | A |
+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- T = Torch
- I = Infant bed
- A = American dipper
- J = Jay
- T = Terrapin
- M = Microwave oven
- B = Baseball player
- H = Harvestman
- N = Neck brace

You start at the position where the torch is located (bottom-left corner).
