Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

```
Cabbage - Poke bonnet - Gorilla
Great grey owl - Garbage truck - Bib
Carousel - Common squirrel monkey - Tiger beetle
```

You start at the position where the common squirrel monkey is located, which is the bottom-middle of the grid.

1. You go left by one step: You are now at the position of the carousel (bottom-left).
2. You go up by one step: You are now at the position of the great grey owl (middle-left).
3. You go right by one step: You are now at the position of the garbage truck (middle-center).
4. You go down by one step: You are now at the position of the common squirrel monkey again (bottom-middle).

Answer: You will find the common squirrel monkey.
