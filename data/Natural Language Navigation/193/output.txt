Let's first map out the grid based on the initial instructions:

Starting from the bottom-left corner and moving right:
1. Paintbrush (bottom-left corner)
2. Vault
3. Restaurant (bottom-right corner)

Then moving up from the restaurant:
4. Bolete (right-middle)
5. Dugong (center)
6. Windsor tie (left-middle)

Then moving up from the Windsor tie:
7. Bakery (top-left corner)
8. Gown
9. Impala (top-right corner)

The grid now looks like this:

```
| Bakery | Gown | Impala |
| Windsor tie | Dugong | Bolete |
| Paintbrush | Vault | Restaurant |
```

Now, starting from the position where the dugong is located (center of the grid):

1. Go up by one step: You arrive at the Gown.
2. Go left by one step: You arrive at the Bakery.
3. Go down by one step: You arrive at the Windsor tie.
4. Go right by one step: You arrive back at the Dugong.

Answer: You will find the Dugong.
