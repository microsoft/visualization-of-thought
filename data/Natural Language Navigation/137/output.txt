Let's first map out the items on the 3x3 grid based on the instructions given:

1. Start at the bottom-left corner with a Lakeland Terrier.
2. Move right to find a cornet.
3. Move right to find a power drill.
4. Move up to find a badger.
5. Move left to find a taxicab.
6. Move left to find a fig.
7. Move up to find a Boston Terrier.
8. Move right to find a Dandie Dinmont Terrier.
9. Move right to find a desktop computer.

The grid now looks like this:

```
| Boston Terrier | Dandie Dinmont Terrier | Desktop Computer |
|----------------|------------------------|------------------|
| Fig            | Taxicab                | Badger           |
| Lakeland Terrier | Cornet                | Power Drill      |
```

Now, starting from the taxicab's position:

1. Move right by one step: You are now at the position of the badger.
2. Move down by one step: You are now at the position of the power drill.
3. Move left by one step: You are now at the position of the cornet.
4. Move right by one step: You are now back at the position of the power drill.

Answer: You will find a power drill.
