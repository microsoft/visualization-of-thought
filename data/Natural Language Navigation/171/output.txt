Let's first map out the grid based on the initial information provided:

```
Mexican hairless dog - Sea urchin - Freight car
Bustard - Drumstick - Terrapin
Hook - Pig - Pickup truck
```

You start at the position where the bustard is located:

```
Mexican hairless dog - Sea urchin - Freight car
* Bustard * - Drumstick - Terrapin
Hook - Pig - Pickup truck
```

Then you go down by one step (to the position of the hook):

```
Mexican hairless dog - Sea urchin - Freight car
Bustard - Drumstick - Terrapin
* Hook * - Pig - Pickup truck
```

Then you go right by one step (to the position of the pig):

```
Mexican hairless dog - Sea urchin - Freight car
Bustard - Drumstick - Terrapin
Hook - * Pig * - Pickup truck
```

Then you go right by one step (to the position of the pickup truck):

```
Mexican hairless dog - Sea urchin - Freight car
Bustard - Drumstick - Terrapin
Hook - Pig - * Pickup truck *
```

Then you go up by one step (to the position of the terrapin):

```
Mexican hairless dog - Sea urchin - Freight car
Bustard - Drumstick - * Terrapin *
Hook - Pig - Pickup truck
```

Then you go up by one step (to the position of the freight car):

```
Mexican hairless dog - Sea urchin - * Freight car *
Bustard - Drumstick - Terrapin
Hook - Pig - Pickup truck
```

Then you go left by one step (to the position of the sea urchin):

```
Mexican hairless dog - * Sea urchin * - Freight car
Bustard - Drumstick - Terrapin
Hook - Pig - Pickup truck
```

Then you go left by one step (to the position of the Mexican hairless dog):

```
* Mexican hairless dog * - Sea urchin - Freight car
Bustard - Drumstick - Terrapin
Hook - Pig - Pickup truck
```

Finally, you go down by one step (to the position of the bustard):

```
Mexican hairless dog - Sea urchin - Freight car
* Bustard * - Drumstick - Terrapin
Hook - Pig - Pickup truck
```

So, after following all the steps, you will find the bustard again.
