Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

```
+---+---+---+
| P | W | A |
+---+---+---+
| T | F | L |
+---+---+---+
| B | H | C |
+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- P = Potter's Wheel
- W = White-headed Capuchin
- A = Alp
- T = Tree Frog
- F = Laptop Computer
- L = Pole
- B = Bee Eater
- H = Hartebeest
- C = Laptop Computer (again, as it's the same item in the rightmost column)

Now, you start at the position where the Tree Frog is located:

```
+---+---+---+
| P | W | A |
+---+---+---+
| T | F | L |
+---+---+---+
| B | H | C |
+---+---+---+
```

Then you go right by one step:

```
+---+---+---+
| P | W | A |
+---+---+---+
| T | F | L |
+---+---+---+
| B | H | C |
+---+---+---+
```

Now you are at the position where the Laptop Computer is located.

Then you go down by one step:

```
+---+---+---+
| P | W | A |
+---+---+---+
| T | F | L |
+---+---+---+
| B | H | C |
+---+---+---+
```

Now you are at the position where the Hartebeest is located.

Then you go left by one step:

```
+---+---+---+
| P | W | A |
+---+---+---+
| T | F | L |
+---+---+---+
| B | H | C |
+---+---+---+
```

Now you are at the position where the Bee Eater is located.

Finally, you go up by one step:

```
+---+---+---+
| P | W | A |
+---+---+---+
| T | F | L |
+---+---+---+
| B | H | C |
+---+---+---+
```

Now you are at the position where the Tree Frog is located again.

Answer: You will find a Tree Frog.
