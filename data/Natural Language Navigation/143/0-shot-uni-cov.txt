You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a junco, then you go right, where you will find a purse, then you go right, where you will find an eastern diamondback rattlesnake. Then you go up, where you will find a gown, then you go left, where you will find an alligator lizard, then you go left, where you will find a crutch. Then you go up, where you will find a mink, then you go right, where you will find a triumphal arch, then you go right, where you will find a chocolate syrup. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the crutch is located, then you go right by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go down by one step, and then you go up by one step. What will you find?
