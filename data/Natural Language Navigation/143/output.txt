Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

1. Start at the bottom-left corner with a junco.
2. Move right to find a purse.
3. Move right to find an eastern diamondback rattlesnake.
4. Move up to find a gown.
5. Move left to find an alligator lizard.
6. Move left to find a crutch.
7. Move up to find a mink.
8. Move right to find a triumphal arch.
9. Move right to find a chocolate syrup.

The grid now looks like this:

```
| mink | triumphal arch | chocolate syrup |
| crutch | alligator lizard | gown |
| junco | purse | eastern diamondback rattlesnake |
```

Now, starting from the crutch:

1. Move right by one step to the alligator lizard.
2. Move right by one step to the gown.
3. Move down by one step to the eastern diamondback rattlesnake.
4. Move up by one step to the gown.

After these steps, you will find yourself at the position of the gown.
