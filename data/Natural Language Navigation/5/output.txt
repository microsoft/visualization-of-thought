Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

```
+---+---+---+
| C | I | S |
+---+---+---+
| B | A | Q |
+---+---+---+
| T | N | B |
+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- C is for Chickadee
- I is for Ibizan Hound
- S is for Square academic cap
- B is for Brambling
- A is for Alpine ibex
- Q is for Quill
- T is for Box Turtle
- N is for Newt
- B is for Boa Constrictor

You start at the position where the Alpine ibex (A) is located:

```
+---+---+---+
| C | I | S |
+---+---+---+
| B | A | Q |
+---+---+---+
| T | N | B |
+---+---+---+
```

Then you go down by one step:

```
+---+---+---+
| C | I | S |
+---+---+---+
| B |   | Q |
+---+---+---+
| T | A | B |
+---+---+---+
```

Then you go left by one step:

```
+---+---+---+
| C | I | S |
+---+---+---+
| B |   | Q |
+---+---+---+
| A | T | B |
+---+---+---+
```

Then you go up by one step:

```
+---+---+---+
| C | I | S |
+---+---+---+
| A |   | Q |
+---+---+---+
|   | T | B |
+---+---+---+
```

And finally, you go right by one step:

```
+---+---+---+
| C | I | S |
+---+---+---+
|   | A | Q |
+---+---+---+
|   | T | B |
+---+---+---+
```

You will find the Alpine ibex again, as you have returned to the original position of the Alpine ibex after making the sequence of moves.

Answer: You will find the Alpine ibex.
