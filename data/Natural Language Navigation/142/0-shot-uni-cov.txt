You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a Mexican hairless dog, then you go right, where you will find a hippopotamus, then you go right, where you will find a chainsaw. Then you go up, where you will find an assault rifle, then you go left, where you will find a china cabinet, then you go left, where you will find a dock. Then you go up, where you will find an amphibious vehicle, then you go right, where you will find a crane (machine), then you go right, where you will find a European polecat. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the china cabinet is located, then you go left by one step, then you go down by one step, then you go right by one step, and then you go up by one step.
