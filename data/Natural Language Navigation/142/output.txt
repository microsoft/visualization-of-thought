Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

1. Start at the bottom-left corner with a Mexican hairless dog.
2. Move right to find a hippopotamus.
3. Move right again to find a chainsaw.
4. Move up to find an assault rifle.
5. Move left to find a china cabinet.
6. Move left again to find a dock.
7. Move up to find an amphibious vehicle.
8. Move right to find a crane (machine).
9. Move right to find a European polecat.

The grid now looks like this:

```
| amphibious vehicle | crane (machine) | European polecat |
| dock               | china cabinet   | assault rifle    |
| Mexican hairless dog | hippopotamus    | chainsaw         |
```

Now, starting from the china cabinet:

1. Move left to find a dock.
2. Move down to find a Mexican hairless dog.
3. Move right to find a hippopotamus.
4. Move up to find a china cabinet again.

So, after following the instructions, you will find a china cabinet.
