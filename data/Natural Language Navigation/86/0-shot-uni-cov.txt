You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a smooth green snake, then you go right, where you will find a sulphur-crested cockatoo, then you go right, where you will find a sawmill. Then you go up, where you will find a Bloodhound, then you go left, where you will find a centipede, then you go left, where you will find a poke bonnet. Then you go up, where you will find a laptop computer, then you go right, where you will find a red wolf, then you go right, where you will find a magnetic compass. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the smooth green snake is located, then you go up by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go down by one step, then you go left by one step, and then you go left by one step. What will you find?
