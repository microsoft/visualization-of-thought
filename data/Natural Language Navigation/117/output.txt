Let's first map out the grid based on the initial instructions:

```
vacuum cleaner - borzoi - aircraft carrier
mop - combination lock - grey whale
lemon - stupa - jeep
```

Now, we start at the combination lock and follow the instructions:

1. Start at the combination lock.
2. Go up by one step: You arrive at the borzoi.
3. Go right by one step: You arrive at the aircraft carrier.
4. Go down by one step: You arrive at the jeep.
5. Go down by one step: You cannot move down because you are already at the bottom row of the grid. This instruction is not possible.
6. Go left by one step: Since the previous step was not possible, we cannot proceed further with the instructions.

However, since we are looking for a final answer, let's assume that the instruction to move down from the bottom row was a mistake, and we should ignore it. If we continue from the jeep:

6. Go left by one step: You arrive at the stupa.
7. Go left by one step: You arrive at the lemon.
8. Go right by one step: You arrive back at the stupa.

So, if we ignore the impossible instruction to move down from the bottom row, the final position would be at the stupa.

Answer: stupa
