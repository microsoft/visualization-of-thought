Let's first map out the grid based on the information given:

1. Start at the bottom-left corner with a promontory.
2. Move right to find a strawberry.
3. Move right to find a goldfish.
4. Move up to find a shower curtain.
5. Move left to find a throne.
6. Move left to find a bathtub.
7. Move up to find a white-headed capuchin.
8. Move right to find a gong.
9. Move right to find a cardoon.

The grid now looks like this:

```
| white-headed capuchin | gong | cardoon |
| bathtub               | throne | shower curtain |
| promontory            | strawberry | goldfish |
```

Now, you start at the throne and make the following moves:
1. Move right by one step: You are now at the shower curtain.
2. Move up by one step: You are now at the gong.
3. Move down by one step: You return to the shower curtain.

Answer: You will find a shower curtain.
