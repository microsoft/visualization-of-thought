Let's first map out the grid based on the initial instructions:

```
langur - Bluetick Coonhound - grey wolf
dowitcher - bulletproof vest - pier
half-track - plate - promontory
```

You start at the position where the plate is located, which is the bottom-middle of the grid. Now, follow the instructions:

1. Go right by one step: You move from the plate to the promontory.
2. Go up by one step: You move from the promontory to the pier.
3. Go up by one step: You move from the pier to the Bluetick Coonhound.
4. Go left by one step: You move from the Bluetick Coonhound to the langur.
5. Go left by one step: You move from the langur to the dowitcher.
6. Go down by one step: You move from the dowitcher to the bulletproof vest.
7. Go down by one step: You move from the bulletproof vest to the half-track.
8. Go right by one step: You move from the half-track to the plate.

After following all the steps, you end up at the plate again.
