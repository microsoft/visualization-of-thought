Let's first map out the grid based on the initial instructions:

1. Start at the bottom-left corner with a pomegranate.
2. Move right to find a wall clock.
3. Move right to find a Granny Smith.
4. Move up to find a Kerry Blue Terrier.
5. Move left to find a military cap.
6. Move left to find a hartebeest.
7. Move up to find a Chihuahua.
8. Move right to find a running shoe.
9. Move right to find a spoonbill.

The grid now looks like this:

```
Chihuahua | Running Shoe | Spoonbill
Hartebeest | Military Cap | Kerry Blue Terrier
Pomegranate | Wall Clock | Granny Smith
```

Now, you start at the position where the wall clock is located and follow the new set of instructions:

1. Start at the wall clock.
2. Move left to find a pomegranate.
3. Move up to find a hartebeest.
4. Move up to find a Chihuahua.
5. Move right to find a running shoe.
6. Move down to find a military cap.
7. Move down to find a wall clock.

After following these steps, you end up at the position where the wall clock is located again.
