Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

1. Start at the bottom-left corner with a Pickelhaube.
2. Move right to a toy store.
3. Move right to a sea lion.
4. Move up to an eastern diamondback rattlesnake.
5. Move left to a maraca.
6. Move left to a tank.
7. Move up to a beaver.
8. Move right to an English Setter.
9. Move right to an altar.

The grid now looks like this:

```
| beaver | English Setter | altar |
| tank   | maraca         | eastern diamondback rattlesnake |
| Pickelhaube | toy store | sea lion |
```

Now, you start at the position where the maraca is located:

| beaver | English Setter | altar |
| tank   | **maraca**     | eastern diamondback rattlesnake |
| Pickelhaube | toy store | sea lion |

Then you go down by one step:

| beaver | English Setter | altar |
| tank   | maraca         | eastern diamondback rattlesnake |
| Pickelhaube | **toy store** | sea lion |

Then you go right by one step:

| beaver | English Setter | altar |
| tank   | maraca         | eastern diamondback rattlesnake |
| Pickelhaube | toy store | **sea lion** |

Then you go up by one step:

| beaver | English Setter | altar |
| tank   | maraca         | **eastern diamondback rattlesnake** |
| Pickelhaube | toy store | sea lion |

And finally, you go left by one step:

| beaver | English Setter | altar |
| tank   | **maraca**     | eastern diamondback rattlesnake |
| Pickelhaube | toy store | sea lion |

You end up back at the position where the maraca is located.

Answer: You will find a maraca.
