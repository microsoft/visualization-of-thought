Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

```
Old English Sheepdog - Pineapple - Pencil Case
Golden Retriever     - Fire Screen Sheet - Teddy Bear
Black and Tan Coonhound - Crane (Bird) - Ruffed Grouse
```

You start at the position where the crane (bird) is located, which is the center of the bottom row.

1. You go up by one step: You are now at the position of the fire screen sheet, which is the center of the grid.
2. You go right by one step: You are now at the position of the teddy bear, which is the center of the right column.
3. You go down by one step: You are now at the position of the ruffed grouse, which is the bottom-right corner of the grid.
4. You go left by one step: You are now back at the position of the crane (bird), which is the center of the bottom row.

So, after following the instructions, you end up at the position where you started, which is where the crane (bird) is located.

Answer: You will find the crane (bird).
