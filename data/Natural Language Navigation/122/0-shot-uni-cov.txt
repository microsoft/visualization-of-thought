You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a Black and Tan Coonhound, then you go right, where you will find a crane (bird), then you go right, where you will find a ruffed grouse. Then you go up, where you will find a teddy bear, then you go left, where you will find a fire screen sheet, then you go left, where you will find a Golden Retriever. Then you go up, where you will find an Old English Sheepdog, then you go right, where you will find a pineapple, then you go right, where you will find a pencil case. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the crane (bird) is located, then you go up by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go down by one step, and then you go left by one step. What will you find?
