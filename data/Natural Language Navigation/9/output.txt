Let's first map out the grid based on the initial information provided:

```
+---+---+---+
| M | S | D |
+---+---+---+
| L | T | C |
+---+---+---+
| C | B | B |
+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- M = Microphone
- S = Sewing machine
- D = Drum
- L = Lacewing
- T = Toaster
- C = Clumber Spaniel
- C = Chimpanzee
- B = Bakery
- B = Boxer

Now, you start at the position where the toaster is located. Let's follow the instructions from there:

1. Start at the Toaster (T).
2. Go right by one step -> Clumber Spaniel (C).
3. Go right by one step -> Lacewing (L).
4. Go up by one step -> Sewing machine (S).
5. Go left by one step -> Microphone (M).
6. Go left by one step -> Drum (D).
7. Go down by one step -> Boxer (B).

So, after following the instructions, you will find a Boxer.

Answer: Boxer
