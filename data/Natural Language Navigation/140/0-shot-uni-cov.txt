You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a great grey owl, then you go right, where you will find a rhinoceros beetle, then you go right, where you will find a coffeemaker. Then you go up, where you will find an American black bear, then you go left, where you will find a crayfish, then you go left, where you will find an ox. Then you go up, where you will find a European polecat, then you go right, where you will find a mixing bowl, then you go right, where you will find a website. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the ox is located, then you go right by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go down by one step, and then you go left by one step. What will you find?
