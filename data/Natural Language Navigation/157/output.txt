Let's first map out the grid with the items you've described:

```
+---+---+---+
| R | H | D |
+---+---+---+
| A | P | S |
+---+---+---+
| U | N | C |
+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- U = Upright piano
- N = Snail
- C = Stretcher
- A = Ant
- P = Purse
- S = Catamaran
- R = Rugby ball
- H = Howler monkey
- D = Dam

You start at the position where the purse is located:

```
+---+---+---+
| R | H | D |
+---+---+---+
| A | P | S |
+---+---+---+
| U | N | C |
+---+---+---+
```

Then you go left by one step (to the Ant):

```
+---+---+---+
| R | H | D |
+---+---+---+
| A | P | S |
+---+---+---+
| U | N | C |
+---+---+---+
```

Then you go up by one step (to the Rugby ball):

```
+---+---+---+
| R | H | D |
+---+---+---+
| A | P | S |
+---+---+---+
| U | N | C |
+---+---+---+
```

Then you go right by one step (to the Howler monkey):

```
+---+---+---+
| R | H | D |
+---+---+---+
| A | P | S |
+---+---+---+
| U | N | C |
+---+---+---+
```

Then you go right by one step (to the Dam):

```
+---+---+---+
| R | H | D |
+---+---+---+
| A | P | S |
+---+---+---+
| U | N | C |
+---+---+---+
```

Then you go down by one step (to the Catamaran):

```
+---+---+---+
| R | H | D |
+---+---+---+
| A | P | S |
+---+---+---+
| U | N | C |
+---+---+---+
```

And finally, you go left by one step (back to the Purse):

```
+---+---+---+
| R | H | D |
+---+---+---+
| A | P | S |
+---+---+---+
| U | N | C |
+---+---+---+
```

So, after following all the steps, you will find the Purse again.
