Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

```
+---+---+---+
| g | r | a |
+---+---+---+
| d | p | b |
+---+---+---+
| w | s | e |
+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- g = gown
- r = rhinoceros beetle
- a = artichoke
- d = dingo
- p = pajamas
- b = Basenji
- w = Wire Fox Terrier
- s = stretcher
- e = African bush elephant

You start at the position where the dingo is located:

```
+---+---+---+
| g | r | a |
+---+---+---+
| X | p | b |
+---+---+---+
| w | s | e |
+---+---+---+
```

Then you go right by one step:

```
+---+---+---+
| g | r | a |
+---+---+---+
| d | X | b |
+---+---+---+
| w | s | e |
+---+---+---+
```

Then you go down by one step:

```
+---+---+---+
| g | r | a |
+---+---+---+
| d | p | b |
+---+---+---+
| w | X | e |
+---+---+---+
```

Then you go left by one step:

```
+---+---+---+
| g | r | a |
+---+---+---+
| d | p | b |
+---+---+---+
| X | s | e |
+---+---+---+
```

And finally, you go up by one step:

```
+---+---+---+
| g | r | a |
+---+---+---+
| X | p | b |
+---+---+---+
| w | s | e |
+---+---+---+
```

You will find the dingo again.

Answer: You will find a dingo.
