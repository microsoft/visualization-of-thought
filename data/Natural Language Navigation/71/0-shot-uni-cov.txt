You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a weighing scale, then you go right, where you will find a lipstick, then you go right, where you will find a table lamp. Then you go up, where you will find a brown bear, then you go left, where you will find a pill bottle, then you go left, where you will find a slug. Then you go up, where you will find an American alligator, then you go right, where you will find an American lobster, then you go right, where you will find an oystercatcher. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the weighing scale is located, then you go right by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go left by one step, then you go down by one step, and then you go right by one step.
