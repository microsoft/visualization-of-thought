Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

```
+---+---+---+
| B | S | I |
+---+---+---+
| O | P | T |
+---+---+---+
| M | S | T |
+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- M = Meerkat
- S = Soda bottle
- T = Tub
- P = Petri dish
- O = Oystercatcher
- S = Scottish Terrier
- B = Birdhouse
- S = Staffordshire Bull Terrier
- I = Indigo bunting

You start at the position where the meerkat is located (bottom-left corner). Then you go up by one step, which brings you to the oystercatcher. After that, you go down by one step, which brings you back to the meerkat.

Answer: You will find a meerkat.
