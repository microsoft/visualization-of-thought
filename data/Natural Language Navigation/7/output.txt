Let's first map out the grid based on the initial description:

```
slip-on shoe - langur - Australian Terrier
sea snake - Leonberger - jaguar
padlock - honeycomb - jaguar
```

Now, let's follow the instructions from the honeycomb's position:

1. Start at the honeycomb (bottom-middle).
2. Go right by one step: You are now at the position of the jaguar (bottom-right).
3. Go up by one step: You are now at the position of the Leonberger (middle-right).
4. Go left by one step: You are now at the position of the sea snake (middle-middle).
5. Go up by one step: You are now at the position of the langur (top-middle).
6. Go left by one step: You are now at the position of the slip-on shoe (top-left).
7. Go down by one step: You are now at the position of the plate (middle-left).
8. Go right by one step: You are now at the position of the sea snake (middle-middle).

After following these steps, you will find the sea snake.
