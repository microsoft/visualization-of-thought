You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a broom, then you go right, where you will find a Saluki, then you go right, where you will find an acoustic guitar. Then you go up, where you will find a rapeseed, then you go left, where you will find an Appenzeller Sennenhund, then you go left, where you will find a Samoyed. Then you go up, where you will find a dhole, then you go right, where you will find a mobile phone, then you go right, where you will find a bassinet. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the broom is located, then you go right by one step, and then you go left by one step. What will you find?
