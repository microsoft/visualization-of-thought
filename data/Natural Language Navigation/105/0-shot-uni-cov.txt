You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a seat belt, then you go right, where you will find an agaric, then you go right, where you will find a harmonica. Then you go up, where you will find a longhorn beetle, then you go left, where you will find a vine snake, then you go left, where you will find a Dobermann. Then you go up, where you will find a Siamese cat, then you go right, where you will find a Great Dane, then you go right, where you will find a window shade. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the seat belt is located, then you go right by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go left by one step, and then you go down by one step. What will you find?
