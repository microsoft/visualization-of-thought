Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

```
Siamese cat - Great Dane - Window shade
Dobermann - Vine snake - Longhorn beetle
Seat belt - Agaric - Harmonica
```

You start at the bottom-left corner where the seat belt is located:

```
Siamese cat - Great Dane - Window shade
Dobermann - Vine snake - Longhorn beetle
*Seat belt* - Agaric - Harmonica
```

Then you go right by one step, to the agaric:

```
Siamese cat - Great Dane - Window shade
Dobermann - Vine snake - Longhorn beetle
Seat belt - *Agaric* - Harmonica
```

Then you go up by one step, to the vine snake:

```
Siamese cat - Great Dane - Window shade
Dobermann - *Vine snake* - Longhorn beetle
Seat belt - Agaric - Harmonica
```

Then you go left by one step, to the Dobermann:

```
Siamese cat - Great Dane - Window shade
*Dobermann* - Vine snake - Longhorn beetle
Seat belt - Agaric - Harmonica
```

Finally, you go down by one step, which brings you back to the seat belt:

```
Siamese cat - Great Dane - Window shade
Dobermann - Vine snake - Longhorn beetle
*Seat belt* - Agaric - Harmonica
```
