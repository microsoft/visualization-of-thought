You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a lion, then you go right, where you will find a safe, then you go right, where you will find a hammerhead shark. Then you go up, where you will find a rain barrel, then you go left, where you will find a barbershop, then you go left, where you will find a langur. Then you go up, where you will find an American black bear, then you go right, where you will find an aircraft carrier, then you go right, where you will find a carousel. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the lion is located, then you go right by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go left by one step, and then you go down by one step. What will you find?
