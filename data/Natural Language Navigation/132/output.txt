Let's first map out the grid based on the information given:

1. Start at the bottom-left corner with a partridge.
2. Move right to a toy store.
3. Move right to a soap dispenser.
4. Move up to a black-footed ferret.
5. Move left to wool.
6. Move left to a rock beauty.
7. Move up to a fire salamander.
8. Move right to an Irish Terrier.
9. Move right to an Asian elephant.

The grid now looks like this:

```
| fire salamander | Irish Terrier | Asian elephant |
| rock beauty     | wool          | black-footed ferret |
| partridge       | toy store     | soap dispenser |
```

Now, you start at the toy store and move left by one step, which brings you to the partridge. Then, you move right by one step, which brings you back to the toy store.

Answer: You will find the toy store.
