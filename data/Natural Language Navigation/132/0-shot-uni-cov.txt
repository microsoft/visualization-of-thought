You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a partridge, then you go right, where you will find a toy store, then you go right, where you will find a soap dispenser. Then you go up, where you will find a black-footed ferret, then you go left, where you will find a wool, then you go left, where you will find a rock beauty. Then you go up, where you will find a fire salamander, then you go right, where you will find an Irish Terrier, then you go right, where you will find an Asian elephant. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the toy store is located, then you go left by one step, and then you go right by one step. What will you find?
