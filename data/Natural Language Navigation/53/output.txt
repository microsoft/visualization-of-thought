Let's first map out the items on the 3x3 grid based on the initial instructions:

```
power drill - lawn mower - geyser
limpkin     - harvester  - tank suit

1. Go left by one step: We move from the candle to the lampshade.
2. Go up by one step: We move from the lampshade to the limpkin.
3. Go up by one step: We move from the limpkin to the power drill.
4. Go right by one step: We move from the power drill to the lawn mower.
5. Go right by one step: We move from the lawn mower to the geyser.
6. Go down by one step: We move from the geyser to the tank suit.
7. Go down by one step: We move from the tank suit to the cricket.
