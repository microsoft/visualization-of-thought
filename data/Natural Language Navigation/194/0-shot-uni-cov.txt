You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a rose hip, then you go right, where you will find a ski, then you go right, where you will find a spotted salamander. Then you go up, where you will find a shoal, then you go left, where you will find an indri, then you go left, where you will find a King Charles Spaniel. Then you go up, where you will find a hamster, then you go right, where you will find a solar thermal collector, then you go right, where you will find a howler monkey. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the ski is located, then you go right by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go left by one step, then you go down by one step, then you go left by one step, then you go up by one step, and then you go right by one step. What will you find?
