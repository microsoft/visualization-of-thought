Let's first map out the grid based on the initial information provided:

```
hamster - solar thermal collector - howler monkey
indri   - shoal                  - King Charles Spaniel
rose hip- ski                    - spotted salamander
```

Now, we start at the position where the ski is located, which is the bottom-middle of the grid. We will follow the instructions step by step:

1. Go right by one step: We move from the ski to the spotted salamander.
2. Go up by one step: We move from the spotted salamander to the King Charles Spaniel.
3. Go up by one step: We move from the King Charles Spaniel to the howler monkey.
4. Go left by one step: We move from the howler monkey to the solar thermal collector.
5. Go down by one step: We move from the solar thermal collector to the shoal.
6. Go left by one step: We move from the shoal to the indri.
7. Go up by one step: We move from the indri to the hamster.
8. Go right by one step: We move from the hamster to the solar thermal collector.

After following all the steps, we end up at the position of the solar thermal collector.

Answer: solar thermal collector
