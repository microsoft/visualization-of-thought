Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

Starting from the bottom-left corner:

1. Bottom-left corner: Lorikeet
2. Move right: Sombrero
3. Move right: Menu
4. Move up: Canoe
5. Move left: Howler Monkey
6. Move left: Stage
7. Move up: Fire Engine
8. Move right: Marimba
9. Move right: Harvester

The grid now looks like this:

```
| Fire Engine | Marimba     | Harvester   |
| Stage       | Howler Monkey | Canoe      |
| Lorikeet    | Sombrero    | Menu        |
```

Now, starting from the Lorikeet's position, we follow the instructions:

1. Go up by one step: Stage
2. Go right by one step: Howler Monkey
3. Go up by one step: Marimba
4. Go right by one step: Harvester
5. Go down by one step: Canoe
6. Go left by one step: Howler Monkey

After following these steps, we end up at the position where the Howler Monkey is located.
