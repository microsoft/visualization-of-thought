Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

```
harmonica - horizontal bar - hoop skirt
tank      - computer mouse - Irish Terrier
vending machine - radio - church
```

You start at the position where the tank is located:

```
harmonica - horizontal bar - hoop skirt
TANK      - computer mouse - Irish Terrier
vending machine - radio - church
```

Then you go right by one step (to the computer mouse):

```
harmonica - horizontal bar - hoop skirt
tank      - COMPUTER MOUSE - Irish Terrier
vending machine - radio - church
```

Then you go down by one step (to the radio):

```
harmonica - horizontal bar - hoop skirt
tank      - computer mouse - Irish Terrier
vending machine - RADIO - church
```

Then you go right by one step (to the church):

```
harmonica - horizontal bar - hoop skirt
tank      - computer mouse - Irish Terrier
vending machine - radio - CHURCH
```

Then you go up by one step (to the Irish Terrier):

```
harmonica - horizontal bar - hoop skirt
tank      - computer mouse - IRISH TERRIER
vending machine - radio - church
```

Then you go up by one step (to the hoop skirt):

```
harmonica - horizontal bar - HOOP SKIRT
tank      - computer mouse - Irish Terrier
vending machine - radio - church
```

Then you go left by one step (to the horizontal bar):

```
harmonica - HORIZONTAL BAR - hoop skirt
tank      - computer mouse - Irish Terrier
vending machine - radio - church
```

And finally, you go down by one step, which brings you to the computer mouse:

```
harmonica - horizontal bar - hoop skirt
tank      - COMPUTER MOUSE - Irish Terrier
vending machine - radio - church
```
