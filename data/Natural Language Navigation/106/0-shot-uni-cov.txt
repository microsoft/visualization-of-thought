You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a quilt, then you go right, where you will find a fig, then you go right, where you will find a prison. Then you go up, where you will find an indigo bunting, then you go left, where you will find an African wild dog, then you go left, where you will find a milk can. Then you go up, where you will find a water buffalo, then you go right, where you will find a barn spider, then you go right, where you will find a Carolina anole.
