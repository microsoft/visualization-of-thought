Let's first map out the grid based on the initial information provided:

```
Water Buffalo - Barn Spider - Carolina Anole
Milk Can       - African Wild Dog - Indigo Bunting
Quilt         - Fig              - Prison
```

You start at the position where the African Wild Dog is located, which is the center of the grid. Now, follow the instructions:

1. Go up by one step: You move from the African Wild Dog to the Barn Spider.
2. Go right by one step: You move from the Barn Spider to the Carolina Anole.
3. Go down by one step: You move from the Carolina Anole to the Prison.
4. Go down by one step: You cannot move down from the Prison because you are already at the bottom row of the grid. This instruction cannot be followed, so you remain at the Prison.
5. Go left by one step: You move from the Prison to the Fig.
6. Go left by one step: You move from the Fig to the Quilt.
7. Go up by one step: You move from the Quilt to the Milk Can.
8. Go up by one step: You move from the Milk Can to the Water Buffalo.

After following all the steps, you end up at the position of the Water Buffalo.
