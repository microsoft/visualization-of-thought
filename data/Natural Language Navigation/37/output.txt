Let's first map out the items on the 3x3 grid based on the initial instructions:

```
croquet ball - cradle - Irish Water Spaniel
ruffed grouse - microphone - cockroach
rifle - mixing bowl - Pickelhaube
```

Now, we start at the position where the mixing bowl is located, which is the bottom-middle of the grid. Then we follow the instructions:

1. Go left by one step: We move from the mixing bowl to the rifle.
2. Go up by one step: We move from the rifle to the ruffed grouse.
3. Go up by one step: We move from the ruffed grouse to the croquet ball.
4. Go right by one step: We move from the croquet ball to the cradle.
5. Go right by one step: We move from the cradle to the Irish Water Spaniel.
6. Go down by one step: We move from the Irish Water Spaniel to the cockroach.
7. Go left by one step: We move from the cockroach to the microphone.
8. Go down by one step: We move from the microphone to the mixing bowl.

After following all the steps, we end up back at the mixing bowl.
