You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a rifle, then you go right, where you will find a mixing bowl, then you go right, where you will find a Pickelhaube.

Then you go up, where you will find a croquet ball, then you go right, where you will find a cradle, then you go right, where you will find an Irish Water Spaniel. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the mixing bowl is located, then you go left by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go down by one step, then you go left by one step, and then you go down by one step.
