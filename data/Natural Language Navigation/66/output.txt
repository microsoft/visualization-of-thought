Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

Starting from the bottom-left corner (flagpole), you move right to find a tabby cat, and then right again to find a chickadee. Then you go up to find a gown, left to find a slip-on shoe, left again to find a Redbone Coonhound. Then you go up to find a tram, right to find a brown bear, and right again to find a chain.

The grid looks like this:

```
| tram          | brown bear | chain          |
| slip-on shoe  | gown       | chickadee      |
| Redbone Coonhound | tabby cat  | flagpole       |
```

Now, you start at the position where the tabby cat is located:

```
| tram          | brown bear | chain          |
| slip-on shoe  | gown       | chickadee      |
| Redbone Coonhound | **tabby cat**  | flagpole       |
```

Then you go up by one step:

```
| tram          | brown bear | chain          |
| slip-on shoe  | **gown**       | chickadee      |
| Redbone Coonhound | tabby cat  | flagpole       |
```

Then you go left by one step:

```
| tram          | brown bear | chain          |
| **slip-on shoe**  | gown       | chickadee      |
| Redbone Coonhound | tabby cat  | flagpole       |
```

Then you go down by one step:

```
| tram          | brown bear | chain          |
| slip-on shoe  | gown       | chickadee      |
| **Redbone Coonhound** | tabby cat  | flagpole       |
```

And finally, you go right by one step:

```
| tram          | brown bear | chain          |
| slip-on shoe  | gown       | chickadee      |
| Redbone Coonhound | **tabby cat**  | flagpole       |
```

You end up back at the position where the tabby cat is located.

Answer: You will find the tabby cat.
