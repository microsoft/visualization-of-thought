Let's first map out the items on the 3x3 grid based on the initial instructions:

```
giant panda | black-footed ferret | ostrich
patio       | cocktail shaker     | radiator
couch       | hair spray          | oboe
```

Now, let's follow the instructions from the position of the hair spray:

1. Start at the hair spray (middle of the bottom row).
2. Go left by one step: You are now at the couch (bottom-left corner).
3. Go up by one step: You are now at the patio (middle-left).
4. Go up by one step: You are now at the giant panda (top-left corner).
5. Go right by one step: You are now at the black-footed ferret (top-middle).
6. Go right by one step: You are now at the ostrich (top-right corner).
7. Go down by one step: You are now at the radiator (middle-right).
8. Go left by one step: You are now at the cocktail shaker (middle of the grid).
9. Go down by one step: You are now at the hair spray (middle of the bottom row).

After following these steps, you will find the hair spray again.
