Let's visualize the grid based on the given instructions:

1. Start at the bottom-left corner with a volleyball.
2. Move right to find a freight car.
3. Move right again to find a Standard Schnauzer.
4. Move up to find an ox.
5. Move left to find a split-rail fence.
6. Move left again to find a dragonfly.
7. Move up to find a bra.
8. Move right to find a frilled-necked lizard.
9. Move right to find a pretzel.

The grid now looks like this:

```
| bra | frilled-necked lizard | pretzel |
| dragonfly | split-rail fence | ox |
| volleyball | freight car | Standard Schnauzer |
```

Now, starting from the volleyball:

1. Go up by one step: You are now at the location of the dragonfly.
2. Go right by one step: You are now at the location of the split-rail fence.
3. Go down by one step: You are now at the location of the freight car.
4. Go left by one step: You are now back at the location of the volleyball.

Answer: You will find a volleyball.
