You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a bathtub, then you go right, where you will find an Alpine ibex, then you go right, where you will find a garfish. Then you go up, where you will find an upright piano, then you go left, where you will find a running shoe, then you go left, where you will find a tray. Then you go up, where you will find a Bullmastiff, then you go right, where you will find a Briard, then you go right, where you will find a unicycle. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the Alpine ibex is located, then you go left by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go left by one step, and then you go down by one step. What will you find?
