Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

```
Bullmastiff - Briard - Unicycle
Tray        - Shoe   - Piano
Bathtub     - Ibex   - Garfish
```

You start at the position where the Alpine ibex is located:

```
Bullmastiff - Briard - Unicycle
Tray        - Shoe   - Piano
Bathtub     - (Ibex) - Garfish
```

Then you go left by one step:

```
Bullmastiff - Briard - Unicycle
Tray        - Shoe   - Piano
(Ibex)      - Ibex   - Garfish
```

Then you go up by one step:

```
Bullmastiff - Briard - Unicycle
(Ibex)      - Shoe   - Piano
Tray        - Ibex   - Garfish
```

Then you go right by one step:

```
Bullmastiff - Briard - Unicycle
Tray        - (Ibex) - Piano
Tray        - Ibex   - Garfish
```

Then you go right by one step:

```
Bullmastiff - Briard - Unicycle
Tray        - Shoe   - (Ibex)
Tray        - Ibex   - Garfish
```

Then you go up by one step:

```
Bullmastiff - Briard - (Ibex)
Tray        - Shoe   - Piano
Tray        - Ibex   - Garfish
```

Then you go left by one step:

```
Bullmastiff - (Ibex) - Unicycle
Tray        - Shoe   - Piano
Tray        - Ibex   - Garfish
```

And finally, you go down by one step:

```
Bullmastiff - Briard - Unicycle
(Ibex)      - Shoe   - Piano
Tray        - Ibex   - Garfish
```

So, after following all the steps, you will find the Tray.
