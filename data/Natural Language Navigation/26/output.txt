Let's first map out the items on the 3x3 grid based on the initial instructions:

```
triumphal arch - thimble - oystercatcher
scabbard       - fire screen sheet - reel
iPod           - unicycle - carbonara
```

You start at the position where the reel is located, which is at the coordinates (2,1) if we consider the bottom-left corner as (0,0).

Now, let's follow the instructions step by step:

1. Go right by one step: You move from the reel to the fire screen sheet.
2. Go up by one step: You move from the fire screen sheet to the thimble.
3. Go right by one step: You move from the thimble to the oystercatcher.
4. Go down by one step: You move from the oystercatcher to the carbonara.
5. Go down by one step: You cannot move down from the carbonara because you are already at the bottom row of the grid. This step is not possible, so you remain at the carbonara.
6. Go left by one step: You move from the carbonara to the unicycle.
7. Go up by one step: You move from the unicycle to the fire screen sheet.

After following all the steps, you end up at the fire screen sheet.

Answer: You will find the fire screen sheet.
