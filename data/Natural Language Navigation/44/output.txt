Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

```
bra - gong - lynx
↑    ←     ↑
hummingbird - common squirrel monkey - chickadee
↑    →     ↑
electric fan - orange - Pomeranian
```

You start at the position where the chickadee is located, which is the top-middle of the grid.

1. Go right by one step: You move from the chickadee to the lynx.
2. Go down by one step: You move from the lynx to the Pomeranian.
3. Go right by one step: You cannot move right because you are at the rightmost edge of the grid.
4. Go up by one step: You move from the Pomeranian to the chickadee.
5. Go left by one step: You move from the chickadee to the common squirrel monkey.

After following these steps, you will find the common squirrel monkey.

Answer: common squirrel monkey
