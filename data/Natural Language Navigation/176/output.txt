Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

```
Carolina anole - Disc brake - Toucan
Hartebeest - Dishwasher - Bluetick Coonhound
Red wine - Typewriter keyboard - Armadillo
```

You start at the position where the hartebeest is located:

```
Carolina anole - Disc brake - Toucan
Hartebeest (start) - Dishwasher - Bluetick Coonhound
Red wine - Typewriter keyboard - Armadillo
```

Then you go right by one step:

```
Carolina anole - Disc brake - Toucan
Hartebeest - Dishwasher (current) - Bluetick Coonhound
Red wine - Typewriter keyboard - Armadillo
```

Then you go up by one step:

```
Carolina anole - Disc brake (current) - Toucan
Hartebeest - Dishwasher - Bluetick Coonhound
Red wine - Typewriter keyboard - Armadillo
```

Then you go left by one step:

```
Carolina anole (current) - Disc brake - Toucan
Hartebeest - Dishwasher - Bluetick Coonhound
Red wine - Typewriter keyboard - Armadillo
```

And finally, you go down by one step:

```
Carolina anole - Disc brake - Toucan
Hartebeest (current) - Dishwasher - Bluetick Coonhound
Red wine - Typewriter keyboard - Armadillo
```

You end up back at the position where the hartebeest is located.
