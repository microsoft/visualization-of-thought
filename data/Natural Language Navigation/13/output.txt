Let's first map out the grid with the items you've described:

```
Promontory - Padlock - Polaroid camera
Packet     - Torch   - Chimpanzee

Now, you start at the position where the packet is located:

```

2. Go right by one step (from Indigo bunting to Clothes iron):

7. Go left by one step (from Promontory off the grid, which is not possible, so we stop at Promontory):
```
Promontory (current) - Padlock - Polaroid camera
