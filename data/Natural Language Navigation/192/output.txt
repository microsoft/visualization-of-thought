Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

1. Start at the bottom-left corner with a tiger shark.
2. Move right to a shopping basket.
3. Move right to a goldfish.
4. Move up to a smooth green snake.
5. Move left to a tobacco shop.
6. Move left to a flute.
7. Move up to a tree frog.
8. Move right to an espresso.
9. Move right to a couch.

The grid now looks like this:

```
| Tree Frog | Espresso | Couch |
| Flute     | Tobacco  | Snake |
| Tiger     | Basket   | Goldfish |
```

Now, starting from the tobacco shop:

1. Go down by one step (to the shopping basket).
2. Go right by one step (to the goldfish).
3. Go up by one step (to the smooth green snake).
4. Go left by one step (back to the tobacco shop).

So, after following the instructions, you end up back at the tobacco shop.

Answer: You will find the tobacco shop.
