You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a red king crab, then you go right, where you will find a snowmobile, then you go right, where you will find a poke bonnet. Then you go up, where you will find a tile roof, then you go left, where you will find a strawberry, then you go left, where you will find a moving van. Then you go up, where you will find a grey whale, then you go right, where you will find a suspension bridge, then you go right, where you will find a front curtain. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the moving van is located, then you go right by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go left by one step, and then you go down by one step. What will you find?
