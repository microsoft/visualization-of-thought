Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

1. Start at the bottom-left corner with a red king crab.
2. Move right to find a snowmobile.
3. Move right again to find a poke bonnet.
4. Move up to find a tile roof.
5. Move left to find a strawberry.
6. Move left again to find a moving van.
7. Move up to find a grey whale.
8. Move right to find a suspension bridge.
9. Move right to find a front curtain.

The grid now looks like this:

```
| Grey Whale | Suspension Bridge | Front Curtain |
| Strawberry | Tile Roof         | Poke Bonnet   |
| Moving Van  | Snowmobile        | Red King Crab |
```

Now, you start at the position where the moving van is located (bottom-left corner of the grid):

```
| Grey Whale | Suspension Bridge | Front Curtain |
| Strawberry | Tile Roof         | Poke Bonnet   |
| Moving Van  | Snowmobile        | Red King Crab |
```

From the moving van, the instructions are as follows:
1. Go right by one step: You will be at the position of the snowmobile.
2. Go up by one step: You will be at the position of the tile roof.
3. Go left by one step: You will be at the position of the strawberry.
4. Go down by one step: You will be back at the position of the moving van.

So, after following the instructions, you will find the moving van again.

Answer: Moving Van
