Let's first map out the grid based on the instructions given:

1. Start at the bottom-left corner with a cowboy hat.
2. Move right to find a black grouse.
3. Move right again to find a nail.
4. Move up to find a Schipperke.
5. Move left to find a laptop computer.
6. Move left again to find a bittern.
7. Move up to find brass.
8. Move right to find an electric fan.
9. Move right again to find a bathtub.

The grid now looks like this:

```
| brass | electric fan | bathtub |
| bittern | laptop computer | Schipperke |
| cowboy hat | black grouse | nail |
```

Now, starting at the laptop computer, we follow the next set of instructions:

1. Move right by one step (to the Schipperke).
2. Move up by one step (to the electric fan).
3. Move left by one step (to the brass).
4. Move down by one step (back to the laptop computer).

After following these steps, we end up back at the laptop computer.

Answer: You will find a laptop computer.
