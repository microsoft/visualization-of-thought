Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

```
+---+---+---+
| M | S | J |
+---+---+---+
| T | P | A |
+---+---+---+
| N | G | C |
+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- M = Menu
- S = Sturgeon
- J = Jaguar
- T = Tibetan Terrier
- P = Promontory
- A = Acorn Squash
- N = Smooth Newt
- G = Grocery Store
- C = Black-and-white Colobus

You start at the position where the Grocery Store (G) is located, which is the center of the bottom row. Then you go right by one step, which brings you to the position of the Black-and-white Colobus (C). Then you go left by one step, which brings you back to the position of the Grocery Store (G).

Answer: You will find the Grocery Store.
