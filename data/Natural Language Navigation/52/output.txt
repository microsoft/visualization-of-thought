Let's visualize the grid based on the given information:

```
+---+---+---+
| H | A | V |
+---+---+---+
| P | S | B |
+---+---+---+
| W | X | P |
+---+---+---+
```

Where:
- H = Holster
- A = Apron
- V = Vacuum cleaner
- P = Power drill
- S = Soup bowl
- B = Bassoon
- W = Window shade
- X = Your starting position (where the bassoon is located)
- P = Pirate ship

Now, let's follow the instructions from the starting position (X):

1. Start at the position where the bassoon is located (X).
2. Go up by one step (to the position of the soup bowl, S).
3. Go right by one step (to the position of the pirate ship, P).
4. Go up by one step (to the position of the apron, A).
5. Go left by one step (to the position of the holster, H).
6. Go down by one step (to the position of the punching bag).

So, after following these steps, you will find a punching bag.

Answer: Punching bag.
