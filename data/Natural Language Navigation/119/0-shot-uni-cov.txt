You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a forklift, then you go right, where you will find a bathtub, then you go right, where you will find a spindle. Then you go up, where you will find an American Staffordshire Terrier, then you go left, where you will find a sunscreen, then you go left, where you will find a lipstick. Then you go up, where you will find a sturgeon, then you go right, where you will find an upright piano, then you go right, where you will find a Schipperke.
