Let's first map out the grid with the items as described:

```
motorboat - Polaroid camera - marmot
scabbard  - goblet          - pinwheel
tarantula - pill bottle     - cassette player
```

You start at the position where the cassette player is located, which is the bottom-right corner of the grid.

Now, follow the instructions step by step:

1. Go down by one step: You can't go down because you're already at the bottom row. So you stay at the cassette player.
2. Go right by one step: You can't go right because you're already at the rightmost column. So you stay at the cassette player.
3. Go up by one step: You move to the pinwheel.
4. Go up by one step: You move to the marmot.
5. Go right by one step: You can't go right because you're already at the rightmost column. So you stay at the marmot.
6. Go down by one step: You move to the pinwheel.
7. Go down by one step: You move to the cassette player.
8. Go left by one step: You move to the pill bottle.

After following all the steps, you end up at the pill bottle.
