Let's first map out the grid based on the initial instructions:

Starting at the bottom-left corner:
1. Hamper (bottom-left)
2. Move right: Briard (bottom-center)
3. Move right: Fig (bottom-right)
4. Move up: Nematode (middle-right)
5. Move left: Umbrella (middle-center)
6. Move left: Shoji (middle-left)
7. Move up: Fly (top-left)
8. Move right: Safe (top-center)
9. Move right: Gas pump (top-right)

The grid now looks like this:

```
| Fly | Safe | Gas pump |
| Shoji | Umbrella | Nematode |
| Hamper | Briard | Fig |
```

Now, following the new set of instructions from the hamper's position:

1. Start at the hamper (bottom-left).
2. Go up by one step: Shoji (middle-left).
3. Go right by one step: Umbrella (middle-center).
4. Go right by one step: Nematode (middle-right).
5. Go down by one step: Fig (bottom-right).
6. Go left by one step: Briard (bottom-center).
7. Go up by one step: Umbrella (middle-center).

Answer: You will find an Umbrella.
