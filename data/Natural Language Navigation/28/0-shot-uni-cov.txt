You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a killer whale, then you go right, where you will find a traffic light, then you go right, where you will find a king penguin. Then you go up, where you will find a bathtub, then you go left, where you will find a Treeing Walker Coonhound, then you go left, where you will find a waste container. Then you go up, where you will find an academic gown, then you go right, where you will find an American coot, then you go right, where you will find an albatross. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the killer whale is located, then you go right by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go left by one step, then you go down by one step, and then you go down by one step. What will you find?
