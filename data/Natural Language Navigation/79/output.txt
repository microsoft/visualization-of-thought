Let's visualize the grid based on the information given:

1. Start at the bottom-left corner with a sleeping bag.
2. Move right to find a kite.
3. Move right to find a fountain.
4. Move up to find a Norwich Terrier.
5. Move left to find a dishcloth.
6. Move left to find a perfume.
7. Move up to find a crate.
8. Move right to find a Dungeness crab.
9. Move right to find a shoji.

The grid now looks like this:

```
| crate | Dungeness crab | shoji |
| perfume | dishcloth | Norwich Terrier |
| sleeping bag | kite | fountain |
```

Now, you start at the position where the dishcloth is located:

```
| crate | Dungeness crab | shoji |
| perfume | **dishcloth** | Norwich Terrier |
| sleeping bag | kite | fountain |
```

Then you go down by one step:

```
| crate | Dungeness crab | shoji |
| perfume | dishcloth | Norwich Terrier |
| sleeping bag | **kite** | fountain |
```

Then you go right by one step:

```
| crate | Dungeness crab | shoji |
| perfume | dishcloth | Norwich Terrier |
| sleeping bag | kite | **fountain** |

```

Then you go up by one step:

```
| crate | Dungeness crab | shoji |
| perfume | dishcloth | **Norwich Terrier** |
| sleeping bag | kite | fountain |
```

And finally, you go left by one step:

```
| crate | Dungeness crab | shoji |
| perfume | **dishcloth** | Norwich Terrier |
| sleeping bag | kite | fountain |
```

You end up back at the position where the dishcloth is located.

Answer: You will find a dishcloth.
