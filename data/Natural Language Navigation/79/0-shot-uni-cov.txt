You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a sleeping bag, then you go right, where you will find a kite, then you go right, where you will find a fountain. Then you go up, where you will find a Norwich Terrier, then you go left, where you will find a dishcloth, then you go left, where you will find a perfume. Then you go up, where you will find a crate, then you go right, where you will find a Dungeness crab, then you go right, where you will find a shoji. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the dishcloth is located, then you go down by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go up by one step, and then you go left by one step. What will you find?
