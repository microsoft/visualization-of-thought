You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a mongoose, then you go right, where you will find a prairie grouse, then you go right, where you will find a cock. Then you go up, where you will find an envelope, then you go left, where you will find a typewriter keyboard, then you go left, where you will find a semi-trailer truck. Then you go up, where you will find a jack-o'-lantern, then you go right, where you will find an African rock python, then you go right, where you will find a tow truck. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the semi-trailer truck is located, then you go down by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go up by one step, then you go left by one step, then you go left by one step, and then you go down by one step. What will you find?
