Let's first map out the grid based on the initial description:

```
jack-o'-lantern | African rock python | tow truck
typewriter keyboard | envelope | cock
semi-trailer truck | prairie grouse | mongoose
```

You start at the position where the semi-trailer truck is located, which is the bottom-left corner of the grid.

Now, follow the instructions:

1. Go down by one step: You can't go down because you are already at the bottom row. So you stay at the semi-trailer truck.
2. Go right by one step: You move to the cell with the prairie grouse.
3. Go right by one step: You move to the cell with the mongoose.
4. Go up by one step: You move to the cell with the cock.
5. Go up by one step: You can't go up because you are already at the top row. So you stay at the cock.
6. Go left by one step: You move to the cell with the envelope.
7. Go left by one step: You move to the cell with the typewriter keyboard.
8. Go down by one step: You move to the cell with the semi-trailer truck.

After following all the steps, you end up back at the semi-trailer truck.

Answer: You will find the semi-trailer truck.
