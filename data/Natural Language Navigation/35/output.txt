Let's first map out the grid based on the initial instructions:

```
Cardigan - Australian Silky Terrier - Desktop Computer
Poke Bonnet - Crock Pot - Dumbbell
Sea Anemone - Mop - Mountain Bike
```

You start at the position where the Crock Pot is located, which is the center of the grid. Now, let's follow the instructions step by step:

1. Go up by one step: You move from the Crock Pot to the Cardigan.
2. Go right by one step: You move from the Cardigan to the Australian Silky Terrier.
3. Go down by one step: You move from the Australian Silky Terrier to the Dumbbell.
4. Go down by one step: You cannot move down from the Dumbbell because you are already at the bottom row of the grid. This step is not possible, so you remain at the Dumbbell.
5. Go left by one step: You move from the Dumbbell to the Crock Pot.
6. Go left by one step: You move from the Crock Pot to the Poke Bonnet.
7. Go up by one step: You move from the Poke Bonnet to the Cardigan.
8. Go up by one step: You cannot move up from the Cardigan because you are already at the top row of the grid. This step is not possible, so you remain at the Cardigan.

After following the instructions, you end up at the Cardigan.
