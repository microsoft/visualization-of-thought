You have been given a 3 by 3 square grid. Starting from a vertex, you will move along the edges of the grid. Initially, you are positioned at the bottom-left corner of the grid, where you will find a sea anemone, then you go right, where you will find a mop, then you go right, where you will find a mountain bike. Then you go up, where you will find a poke bonnet, then you go left, where you will find a Crock Pot, then you go left, where you will find a dumbbell. Then you go up, where you will find a cardigan, then you go right, where you will find an Australian Silky Terrier, then you go right, where you will find a desktop computer. Now you have all the information on the map. You start at the position where the Crock Pot is located, then you go up by one step, then you go right by one step, then you go down by one step, then you go down by one step, then you go left by one step, then you go left by one step, then you go up by one step, and then you go up by one step.
