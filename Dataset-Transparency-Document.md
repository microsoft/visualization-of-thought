# Dataset Transparency Document

## Motivation

- **Purpose**: The dataset was created to support research in the field of spatial reasoning in large language models (LLMs). It aims to address gaps in evaluating and enhancing the spatial reasoning capabilities of LLMs.
- **Creators**: The dataset was created by the research team at Microsoft Research.
- **Comments**: The dataset was designed to evaluate spatial reasoning performance across multiple spatial reasoning tasks, including visual navigation, and visual tiling.

## Composition

- **Instance Representation**: The instances in the dataset represent various spatial reasoning tasks, including 2D grid maps, and geometric shapes. There are multiple types of instances, including textual descriptions, visual grids, and polyomino configurations.
- **Instance Count**: The dataset contains a total of 496 instances for visual navigation (2520 instances for next-step-prediction), and 796 instances for visual tiling.
- **Sampling**: The dataset is a synthetic sample created specifically for the tasks at hand. It is not representative of any larger natural set but is designed to cover a range of difficulties and configurations for spatial reasoning.
- **Data Types**: Each instance consists of raw text (task descriptions and text grids), counterpart images (2D grid maps), and corresponding spatial configurations.
- **Labels/Targets**: Each instance has a answer associated with it, such as the correct navigation path or the correct polyomino piece to fit in a given space.
- **Missing Information**: N/A.
- **Relationships**: Relationships between instances are made explicit through sequential task steps and spatial configurations in the visual navigation and tiling tasks.
- **Data Splits**: N/A. It serves as a testbed instead of training or tuning purpose.
- **Errors/Noise**: Each instance in the dataset is ensured to be associated to an unique solution, otherwise they're discarded.
- **External Resources**: The dataset is self-contained and does not rely on external resources.
- **Confidential Data**: The dataset does not contain any confidential data.
- **Offensive Content**: The dataset does not contain any offensive, insulting, or threatening content.
- **Subpopulations**: The dataset identifies subpopulations by task type and difficulty level.
- **Identifiability**: It is not possible to identify individuals from the dataset.
- **Sensitive Data**: The dataset does not contain any sensitive data.

## Collection Process

- **Data Acquisition**: The data was acquired through synthetic generation methods, including algorithmic generation of navigation instructions and polyomino configurations.
- **Collection Mechanisms**: The data was generated using custom software scripts.
- **Sampling Strategy**: The sampling strategy was deterministic to ensure coverage of all task variations.
- **Collection Team**: The data generation does not involve manual efforts .
- **Third-Party Data**: The data was not collected from third parties.
- **Comments**: This dataset is automatically generated by algorithmic methods. It includes spatial configuration generation and rendering of text grids and counterpart images. The rendering process uses limited emoji icons, including emoji squares, house, building and construction icon. It's unlikely to involve ethical risks.

## Preprocessing/Cleaning/Labeling

- **Preprocessing**: The data was preprocessed by generating spatial configurations, discarding instances where unique answer is not applicable, and labeling the answer with existing algorithmic solvers.
- **Raw Data**: The raw data is saved and accessible through [this link](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v1c7uMw68FrOJq5LMT-RfOGniTR3w1dD/view?usp=sharing).
- **Software**: The software used for preprocessing is available at the corresponding repo.

## Uses

- **Current Uses**: The dataset has been used for evaluating LLMs and different prompting methods in spatial reasoning tasks.
- **Potential Uses**: The dataset could be used for further research in cognitive modeling, spatial reasoning, and advanced LLM training.
- **Limitations**: The dataset has limitations such as the controlled nature of the tasks. To be more specific, in the visual navigation task, the map is controlled to avoid road intersections. And in the visual tiling tasks, not all variants of polyominoes are presented to make the difficulty appropriate for current LLMs. Those tasks are quite easy for humans yet challenging for LLMs. As LLMs continue to improve, this dataset may become too easy to serve as an effective testbed for more advanced models.
- **Prohibited Uses**: This dataset is intended for benchmarking the spatial reasoning ability ofLLMs rather than for training or tuning for specific purposes. Additionally, it is not representative of real-world user scenarios and is unlikely to be used in production environments.

## Distribution

- **Distribution**: The dataset will be distributed to third parties through GitHub and Huggingface.
- **License**: The dataset is distributed under MIT.
- **Third-Party Restrictions**: There are no restrictions imposed by third parties.

## Maintenance

- **Support/Maintenance**: The dataset will be maintained by the VoT team.
- **Contact**: The owner can be contacted with email wenswu@microsoft.com.
- **Updates**: The dataset is unlikely to be updated periodically. Others who want to augment the dataset could build upon the curation code provided.
