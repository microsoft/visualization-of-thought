Task: given a set of polyominoes and corresponding variations of each polyomino, fit them into the empty squares (⬜) in the target rectangle without overlapping any existing polyominoes or going outside the rectangle. The variations allow only translation, not rotation or reflection. It's guaranteed that there always exists a solution.
-------------------------
Target rectangle with ${EMPTY_SQUARES} empty squares:
${TARGET_RECTANGLE}

Provided polyominoes:
${PROVIDED_POLYOMINOES}
-------------------------
${POLYOMINO_VARIATIONS}

To fit all the provided polyominoes into the empty squares (⬜), what's the correct variation of ${CHOSED_POLYOMINO}?
